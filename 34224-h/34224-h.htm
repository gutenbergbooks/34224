<h4>(1781-1838)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capl.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="L" title="L" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ouis Charles Adelaide de Chamisso, known as Adelbert von
Chamisso, the youngest son of Count Louis Marie de Chamisso,
was born in the paternal castle of Boncourt, in
Champagne, January 30th, 1781. Driven into exile by the Revolution,
the family of loyalists sought refuge in the Low Countries and
afterward in Germany, settling in Berlin in 1797. In later years the
other members of the family returned to France and established
themselves once more as Frenchmen in their native land; but Adelbert
von Chamisso, German by nature and
characteristics as well as by virtue of his
early education and environment, struck
root in Germany and was the genuine
product of German soil. In 1796 the young
Chamisso became page to Queen Louise of
Prussia, and while at court, by the Queen's
directions, he received the most careful
education. He was made ensign in 1798
and lieutenant in 1801, in the Regiment
von Goetze. A military career was repugnant
to him, and his French antecedents
did not tend to make his life agreeable
among the German officers. That the service
was not wholly without interest, however,
is shown by the two treatises upon military subjects written by
him in 1798 and 1799.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chamisso</span></span>
</div>

<p>As a young officer he belonged to a romantic brotherhood calling
itself "The Polar Star," which counted among its members his lifelong
friend Hitzig, Alexander zur Lippe, Varnhagen, and other young
writers of the day. He diligently applied himself to the mastery of
the German tongue, made translations of poems and dramas, and to
relieve the irksomeness of his military life incessantly studied
Homer. His most ambitious literary effort of this time was a
'Faust' (1803), a metaphysical, somewhat sophomoric attempt, but
the only one of his early poems that he admitted into his collected
works.</p>

<p>While still in the Prussian army, he edited with Varnhagen and
Neumann a periodical called the Musenalmanach (1804), which existed<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3504]</span>
three years. After repeated but vain efforts to obtain release
from the uncongenial military service, the capitulation of Hameln at
length set him free (1806). He left Germany and went to France;
but, disappointed in his hopes, unsettled and without plans, he
returned, and several years were lost in profitless and desultory
wanderings. From 1810 to 1812 he was again in France. Here he
became acquainted with Alexander von Humboldt and Uhland, and
renewed his friendship with Wilhelm Schlegel. With Helmina von
Ch&eacute;zy he undertook the translation into French of Schlegel's Vienna
lectures upon art and literature. Chamisso was indifferent to the
task, and the translation went on but slowly. To expedite the work
he was invited to stay at Chaumont, the residence of Madame de
Sta&euml;l, where Schlegel was a member of her household. Here his
careless personal habits and his inevitable pipe brought odium upon
him in that polished circle.</p>

<p>Madame de Sta&euml;l was always his friend, and in 1811 he went to
her at Coppet, where by a happy chance he took up the study of
botany, with August de Sta&euml;l as instructor. Filled with enthusiasm
for his new pursuit, he made excursions through Switzerland, collecting
and botanizing. The period of indecision was at an end,
and in 1812, at the age of thirty-one, he matriculated as student of
medicine at the University of Berlin, and applied himself with resolution
to the study of the natural sciences. During the war against
Napoleon he sought refuge in Kunersdorf with the Itzenplitz family,
where he occupied his time with botany and the instruction of young
Itzenplitz. It was during this time (1813) that 'Peter Schlemihl's
Wundersame Geschichte' (Peter Schlemihl's Wonderful History) was
written,&mdash;one of the masterpieces of German literature. His 'Faust'
and 'Fortunatus' had in some degree foreshadowed his later and
more famous work,&mdash;'Faust' in the compact with the devil, 'Fortunatus'
in the possession of the magical wishing-bag. The simple
<i>motif</i> of popular superstition, the loss of one's shadow, familiar in
folk-stories and already developed by Goethe in his 'Tales,' and by
K&ouml;rner in 'Der Teufel von Salamanca' (The Devil of Salamanca),
was treated by Chamisso with admirable simplicity, directness of
style, and realism of detail.</p>

<p>Chamisso's divided allegiance to France and Germany made the
political situation of the times very trying for him, and it was with
joy that he welcomed an appointment as scientist to a Russian polar
expedition, fitted out under the direction of Count Romanzoff, and
commanded by Captain Kotzebue (1815-1818). The record of the
scientific results of this expedition, as published by Kotzebue, was
full of misstatements; and to correct these, Chamisso wrote the
'Tagebuch' (Journal) in 1835, a work whose pure and plastic style<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3505]</span>
places it in the first order of books of travel, and entitles its author,
in point of description, to rank with Von Humboldt among the best
writers of travels of the first half of the century.</p>

<p>After three years of voyaging, Chamisso returned to Berlin, and
in 1819 he was made a member of the Society of Natural Sciences
and received the degree of Ph.D. from the University of Berlin, was
appointed adjunct custodian of the botanical garden in New Sch&ouml;neberg,
and in September of the same year he married Antonie Piaste.</p>

<p>An indemnity granted by France to the French emigrants put him
in possession of the sum of one hundred thousand francs, and in 1825
he again visited Paris, where he remained some months among old
friends and new interests. The period of his great activity was after
this date. His life was now peaceful and domestic. Poetry and
botany flourished side by side. Chamisso, to his own astonishment,
found himself read and admired, and everywhere his songs were
sung. To the influence of his wife we owe the cycles of poems,
'Frauen-Liebe und Leben' (Woman's Love and Life), and 'Lebens
Lieder und Bilder' (Life's Songs and Pictures), for without her they
would have been impossible. The former cycle inspired Robert
Schumann in the first days of his happy married life, and the music
of these songs has made 'Woman's Love and Life' familiar to all
the world. 'Salas y Gomez,' a reminiscence of his voyage around
the world, appeared in the Musenalmanach in 1830. The theme of
this poem was the development of the romantic possibilities suggested
by the sight of the profound loneliness and grandeur of the South
Sea island, Salas y Gomez. Chamisso translated Andersen and
B&eacute;ranger, made translations from the Chinese and Tonga, and his
version of the Eddic Song of Thrym ('Das Lied von Thrym') is
among the best translations from the Icelandic that have been made.</p>

<p>In 1832 he became associate editor of the Berlin Deutscher Musenalmanach,
which position he held until his death, and in his hands
the periodical attained a high degree of influence and importance.
His health failing, he resigned his position at the Botanical Garden,
retiring upon full pay. He died at Berlin, August 21st, 1838.</p>

<p>Frenchman though he was, his entire conception of life and the
whole character of his writings are purely German, and show none
of the French characteristics of his time. Chamisso, as botanist,
traveler, poet, and editor, made important contributions in each and
every field, although outside of Germany his fame rests chiefly upon
his widely known 'Schlemihl,' which has been translated into all the
principal languages of Europe.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BARGAIN" id="THE_BARGAIN"></a>THE BARGAIN</h3>

<h4>From 'The Wonderful History of Peter Schlemihl'</h4>


<p>After a fortunate, but for me very troublesome voyage, we
finally reached the port. The instant that I touched land
in the boat, I loaded myself with my few effects, and passing
through the swarming people I entered the first and least
house before which I saw a sign hang. I requested a room; the
boots measured me with a look, and conducted me into the garret.
I caused fresh water to be brought, and made him exactly
describe to me where I should find Mr. Thomas John.</p>

<p>"Before the north gate; the first country-house on the right
hand; a large new house of red and white marble, with many
columns."</p>

<p>"Good." It was still early in the day. I opened at once my
bundle; took thence my new black-cloth coat; clad myself cleanly
in my best apparel; put my letter of introduction into my pocket,
and set out on the way to the man who was to promote my
modest expectations.</p>

<p>When I had ascended the long North Street, and reached the
gate, I soon saw the pillars glimmer through the foliage. "Here
it is, then," thought I. I wiped the dust from my feet with my
pocket-handkerchief, put my neckcloth in order, and in God's
name rang the bell. The door flew open. In the hall I had an
examination to undergo; the porter however permitted me to be
announced, and I had the honor to be called into the park, where
Mr. John was walking with a select party. I recognized the man
at once by the lustre of his corpulent self-complacency. He
received me very well,&mdash;as a rich man receives a poor devil,&mdash;even
turned towards me, without turning from the rest of the
company, and took the offered letter from my hand. "So, so,
from my brother. I have heard nothing from him for a long
time. But he is well? There," continued he, addressing the
company, without waiting for an answer, and pointing with the
letter to a hill, "there I am going to erect the new building."
He broke the seal without breaking off the conversation, which
turned upon riches.</p>

<p>"He that is not master of a million at least," he observed,
"is&mdash;pardon me the word&mdash;a wretch!"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3507]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, how true!" I exclaimed, with a rush of overflowing
feeling.</p>

<p>That pleased him. He smiled at me and said, "Stay here,
my good friend; in a while I shall perhaps have time to tell
you what I think about this." He pointed to the letter, which
he then thrust into his pocket, and turned again to the company.
He offered his arm to a young lady; the other gentlemen
addressed themselves to other fair ones; each found what suited
him: and all proceeded towards the rose-blossomed mount.</p>

<p>I slid into the rear without troubling any one, for no one
troubled himself any further about me. The company was
excessively lively; there was dalliance and playfulness; trifles
were sometimes discussed with an important tone, but oftener
important matters with levity; and the wit flew with special
gayety over absent friends and their circumstances. I was too
strange to understand much of all this; too anxious and introverted
to take an interest in such riddles.</p>

<p>We had reached the rosery. The lovely Fanny, who seemed
the belle of the day, insisted out of obstinacy in breaking off
a blossomed stem herself. She wounded herself on a thorn, and
the purple streamed from her tender hand as if from the dark
roses. This circumstance put the whole party into a flutter.
English plaster was sought for. A quiet, thin, lanky, longish,
oldish man who stood near, and whom I had not hitherto
remarked, put his hand instantly into the tight breast-pocket of
his old gray French taffeta coat; produced thence a little pocket-book,
opened it, and presented to the lady with a profound
obeisance the required article. She took it without noticing the
giver, and without thanks; the wound was bound up and we
went forward over the hill, from whose back the company could
enjoy the wide prospect over the green labyrinth of the park to
the boundless ocean.</p>

<p>The view was in reality vast and splendid. A light point
appeared on the horizon between the dark flood and the blue of
the heaven. "A telescope here!" cried John; and already,
before the servants who appeared at the call were in motion, the
gray man, modestly bowing, had thrust his hand into his coat
pocket, drawn thence a beautiful Dollond, and handed it to Mr.
John. Bringing it immediately to his eye, he informed the company
that it was the ship which went out yesterday, and was
detained in view of port by contrary winds. The telescope<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3508]</span>
passed from hand to hand, but not again into that of its owner.
I however gazed in wonder at the man, and could not conceive
how the great machine had come out of the narrow pocket;
but this seemed to have struck no one else, and nobody troubled
himself any further about the gray man than about myself.</p>

<p>Refreshments were handed round; the choicest fruits of every
zone, in the costliest vessels. Mr. John did the honors with an
easy grace, and a second time addressed a word to me: "Help
yourself; you have not had the like at sea." I bowed, but he
did not see it; he was already speaking with some one else.</p>

<p>The company would fain have reclined upon the sward on the
slope of the hill, opposite to the outstretched landscape, had
they not feared the dampness of the earth. "It were divine,"
observed one of the party, "had we but a Turkey carpet to
spread here." The wish was scarcely expressed when the man
in the gray coat had his hand in his pocket, and was busied in
drawing thence, with a modest and even humble deportment, a
rich Turkey carpet interwoven with gold. The servants received
it as a matter of course, and opened it on the required spot.
The company, without ceremony, took their places upon it; for
myself, I looked again in amazement on the man&mdash;at the carpet,
which measured about twenty paces long and ten in breadth
and rubbed my eyes, not knowing what to think of it, especially
as nobody saw anything extraordinary in it.</p>

<p>I would fain have had some explanation regarding the man
and have asked who he was, but I knew not to whom to address
myself, for I was almost more afraid of the gentlemen's servants
than of the served gentlemen. At length I took courage, and
stepped up to a young man who appeared to me to be of less
consideration than the rest, and who had often stood alone. I
begged him softly to tell me who the agreeable man in the
gray coat there was.</p>

<p>"He there, who looks like an end of thread that has escaped
out of a tailor's needle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he who stands alone."</p>

<p>"I don't know him," he replied, and&mdash;in order to avoid a
longer conversation with me, apparently&mdash;he turned away and
spoke of indifferent matters to another.</p>

<p>The sun began now to shine more powerfully, and to inconvenience
the ladies. The lovely Fanny addressed carelessly to
the gray man&mdash;whom, as far as I am aware, no one had yet<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3509]</span>
spoken to&mdash;the trifling question whether he "had not, perchance,
also a tent by him?" He answered her by an obeisance most
profound, as if an unmerited honor were done him, and had
already his hand in his pocket, out of which I saw come canvas,
poles, cordage, iron-work,&mdash;in short, everything which belongs to
the most splendid pleasure-tent. The young gentlemen helped
to expand it, and it covered the whole extent of the carpet, and
nobody found anything remarkable in it.</p>

<p>I had already become uneasy&mdash;nay, horrified&mdash;at heart; but
how completely so, as at the very next wish expressed I saw
him pull out of his pocket three roadsters I tell you, three
beautiful great black horses, with saddle and caparison. Take it
in, for Heaven's sake!&mdash;three saddled horses, out of the same
pocket from which already a pocket-book, a telescope, an embroidered
carpet twenty paces long and ten broad, a pleasure-tent
of equal dimensions and all the requisite poles and irons,
had come forth! If I did not protest to you that I saw it
myself with my own eyes, you could not possibly believe it.</p>

<p>Embarrassed and obsequious as the man himself appeared to
be, little as was the attention which had been bestowed upon
him, yet to me his grisly aspect, from which I could not turn
my eyes, became so fearful that I could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>I resolved to steal away from the company, which from the
insignificant part I played in it seemed to me an easy affair.
I proposed to myself to return to the city to try my luck again
on the morrow with Mr. John, and if I could muster the necessary
courage, to question him about the singular gray man. Had
I only had the good fortune to escape so well!</p>

<p>I had already actually succeeded in stealing through the rosery,
and on descending the hill found myself on a piece of lawn,
when, fearing to be encountered in crossing the grass out of the
path, I cast an inquiring glance round me. What was my terror
to behold the man in the gray coat behind me, and making
towards me! The next moment he took off his hat before me,
and bowed so low as no one had ever yet done to me. There
was no doubt but that he wished to address me, and without
being rude I could not prevent it. I also took off my hat,
bowed also, and stood there in the sun with bare head as if
rooted to the ground. I stared at him full of terror, and was
like a bird which a serpent has fascinated. He himself appeared
very much embarrassed. He did not raise his eyes, again bowed<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3510]</span>
repeatedly, drew nearer and addressed me with a soft tremulous
voice, almost in a tone of supplication:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I hope, sir, that you will pardon my boldness in venturing
in so unusual a manner to approach you? but I would ask
a favor. Permit me most condescendingly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But in God's name!" exclaimed I in my trepidation, "what
can I do for a man who&mdash;" we both started, and as I believe,
reddened.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence he again resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"During the short time that I had the happiness to find myself
near you, I have, sir, many times,&mdash;allow me to say it to
you,&mdash;really contemplated with inexpressible admiration the beautiful,
beautiful shadow which, as it were with a certain noble
disdain and without yourself remarking it, you cast from you in
the sunshine. The noble shadow at your feet there! Pardon me
the bold supposition, but possibly you might not be indisposed
to make this shadow over to me."</p>

<p>I was silent, and a mill-wheel seemed to whirl round in my
head. What was I to make of this singular proposition to sell
my own shadow? He must be mad, thought I; and with an
altered tone which was more assimilated to that of his own
humility, I answered him thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! good friend, have not you then enough of your
own shadow? I take this for a business of a very singular sort&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hastily interrupted me:&mdash;"I have many things in my
pocket which, sir, might not appear worthless to you; and for
this inestimable shadow I hold the very highest price too small."</p>

<p>It struck cold through me again as I was reminded of the
pocket. I knew not how I could have called him good friend.
I resumed the conversation, and sought to set all right again by
excessive politeness if possible.</p>

<p>"But, sir, pardon your most humble servant; I do not understand
your meaning. How indeed could my shadow&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted me.</p>

<p>"I beg your permission only here on the spot to be allowed
to take up this noble shadow and put it in my pocket; how I
shall do that, be my care. On the other hand, as a testimony of
my grateful acknowledgment to you, I give you the choice of all
the treasures which I carry in my pocket,&mdash;the genuine 'spring-root,'
the 'mandrake-root,' the 'change-penny,' the 'rob-dollar,'
the 'napkin of Roland's page,' a 'mandrake-man,' at your own<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3511]</span>
price. But these probably don't interest you; rather 'Fortunatus's
wishing-cap,' newly and stoutly repaired, and a lucky-bag
such as he had!"</p>

<p>"The luck-purse of Fortunatus!" I exclaimed, interrupting
him; and great as my anxiety was, with that one word he had
taken my whole mind captive. A dizziness seized me, and double
ducats seemed to glitter before my eyes.</p>

<p>"Honored sir, will you do me the favor to view and to make
trial of this purse?" He thrust his hand into his pocket and
drew out a tolerably large, well-sewed purse of stout Cordovan
leather, with two strong strings, and handed it to me. I plunged
my hand into it, and drew out ten gold pieces, and again ten. I
extended him eagerly my hand. "Agreed! the business is done:
for the purse you have my shadow!"</p>

<p>He closed with me; kneeled instantly down before me, and
I beheld him, with an admirable dexterity, gently loosen my
shadow from top to toe from the grass, lift it up, roll it together,
fold it, and finally pocket it. He arose, made me
another obeisance, and retreated towards the rosery. I fancied
that I heard him there softly laughing to himself, but I held the
purse fast by the strings; all round me lay the clear sunshine,
and within me was yet no power of reflection.</p>

<p>At length I came to myself, and hastened to quit the place
where I had nothing more to expect. In the first place I filled
my pockets with gold; then I secured the strings of the purse
fast round my neck, and concealed the purse itself in my
bosom. I passed unobserved out of the park, reached the highway
and took the road to the city. As, sunk in thought, I
approached the gate, I heard a cry behind me:</p>

<p>"Young gentleman! eh! young gentleman! hear you!"</p>

<p>I looked round; an old woman called after me.</p>

<p>"Do take care, sir, you have lost your shadow!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, good mother!" I threw her a gold piece for
her well-meant intelligence, and stopped under the trees.</p>

<p>At the city gate I was compelled to hear again from the
sentinel, "Where has the gentleman left his shadow?" And
immediately again from some women, "Jesus Maria! the poor
fellow has no shadow!" That began to irritate me, and I
became especially careful not to walk in the sun. This could
not, however, be accomplished everywhere; for instance, over the
broad street I must next take&mdash;actually, as mischief would have<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3512]</span>
it, at the very moment the boys came out of school. A cursed
hunchbacked rogue&mdash;I see him yet&mdash;spied out instantly that
I had no shadow. He proclaimed the fact with a loud outcry
to the whole assembled literary street youth of the suburb,
who began forthwith to criticize me and to pelt me with mud.
"Decent people are accustomed to take their shadow with them
when they go into the sunshine." To defend myself from them
I threw whole handfuls of gold amongst them, and sprang into
a hackney coach which some compassionate soul procured for me.
As soon as I found myself alone in the rolling carriage, I
began to weep bitterly. The presentiment must already have
arisen in me that on earth, far as gold transcends merit and virtue
in estimation, so much higher than gold itself is the shadow
valued; and as I had earlier sacrificed wealth to conscience, I
had now thrown away the shadow for mere gold. What in the
world could and would become of me!</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_ELLERY_CHANNING" id="WILLIAM_ELLERY_CHANNING"></a>WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING</h2>

<h4>(1780-1842)</h4>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capd.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="D" title="D" />
</div><p class="dropcap">r. Channing, the recognized leader although not the originator
of the Unitarian movement in this country, was a
man of singular spirituality, sweetness of disposition, purity
of life, and nobility of character. He was thought by some to be
austere and cold in temperament, and timid in action; but this was
rather a misconception of a life given to conscientious study, and an
effort to allow due weight to opposing arguments. He was not liable
to be swept from his moorings by momentary enthusiasm. As a
writer he was clear and direct, admirably
perspicuous in style, without great ornament,
much addicted to short and simple
sentences, though singularly enough an
admirer of those which were long and
involved. A critic in Fraser's Magazine
wrote of him:&mdash;"Channing is unquestionably
the first writer of the age. From his
writings may be extracted some of the
richest poetry and richest conceptions,
clothed in language&mdash;unfortunately for our
literature&mdash;too little studied in the day in
which we live."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">William E. Channing</span></span>
</div>

<p>He was of "blue blood,"&mdash;the grandson
of William Ellery, one of the signers
of the Declaration,&mdash;and was born at Newport, Rhode Island, April
7th, 1780. He was graduated at Harvard College with high honors in
1798, and first thought of studying medicine, but was inclined to the
direction of the ministry. He became a private tutor in Richmond,
Virginia, where he learned to detest slavery. Here he laid the seeds
of subsequent physical troubles by imprudent indulgence in asceticism,
in a desire to avoid effeminacy. He entered upon the study of
theology, which he continued in Cambridge; he was ordained in
1803, and soon became pastor of the Federal Street Church in Boston,
in charge of which society he passed his ministerial life. In
the following year he was associated with Buckminster and others
in the liberal Congregational movement, and this led him into a position
of controversy with his orthodox brethren,&mdash;one he cordially
disliked. But he could not refrain from preaching the doctrines of
the dignity of human nature, the supremacy of reason, and religious
freedom, of whose truth he was profoundly assured.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3514]</span></p>
<p>It has been truly said that Channing was too much a lover of
free thought, and too desirous to hold only what he thought to be
true, to allow himself to be bound by any party ties. "I wish," he
himself said, "to regard myself as belonging not to a sect but to the
community of free minds, of lovers of truth and followers of Christ,
both on earth and in heaven. I desire to escape the narrow walls of
a particular church, and to stand under the open sky in the broad
light, looking far and wide, seeing with my own eyes, hearing with
my own ears, and following Truth meekly but resolutely, however
arduous or solitary be the path in which she leads."</p>

<p>He was greatly interested in temperance, in the anti-slavery
movement, in the elevation of the laboring classes, and other social
reforms; and after 1824, when Dr. Gannett became associate pastor,
he gave much time to work in these directions. His death occurred
at Bennington, Vermont, April 2d, 1842. His literary achievements
are mainly or wholly in the line of his work,&mdash;sermons, addresses,
and essays; but they were prepared with scrupulous care, and have
the quality naturally to be expected from a man of broad and catholic
spirit, wide interests, and strong love of literature. His works,
in six volumes, are issued by the American Unitarian Association,
which also publishes a 'Memorial' by his nephew, William Henry
Channing, in three volumes.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PASSION_FOR_POWER" id="THE_PASSION_FOR_POWER"></a>THE PASSION FOR POWER</h3>

<h4>From 'The Life and Character of Napoleon Bonaparte'</h4>

<p>The passion for ruling, though most completely developed in
despotisms, is confined to no forms of government. It is
the chief peril of free States, the natural enemy of free
institutions. It agitates our own country, and still throws an
uncertainty over the great experiment we are making here in
behalf of liberty.... It is the distinction of republican
institutions, that whilst they compel the passion for power to
moderate its pretensions, and to satisfy itself with more limited
gratifications, they tend to spread it more widely through the
community, and to make it a universal principle. The doors of
office being opened to all, crowds burn to rush in. A thousand
hands are stretched out to grasp the reins which are denied to
none. Perhaps in this boasted and boasting land of liberty, not
a few, if called to state the chief good of a republic, would
place it in this: that every man is eligible to every office, and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3515]</span>
that the highest places of power and trust are prizes for universal
competition. The superiority attributed by many to our
institutions is, not that they secure the greatest freedom, but give
every man a chance of ruling; not that they reduce the power
of government within the narrowest limits which the safety of
the State admits, but throw it into as many hands as possible.
The despot's great crime is thought to be that he keeps the
delight of dominion to himself, that he makes a monopoly of it;
whilst our more generous institutions, by breaking it into parcels
and inviting the multitude to scramble for it, spread this joy
more widely. The result is that political ambition infects our
country and generates a feverish restlessness and discontent,
which to the monarchist may seem more than a balance for our
forms of liberty. The spirit of intrigue, which in absolute governments
is confined to courts, walks abroad through the land;
and as individuals can accomplish no political purposes single-handed,
they band themselves into parties, ostensibly framed for
public ends, but aiming only at the acquisition of power. The
nominal sovereign,&mdash;that is, the people,&mdash;like all other sovereigns,
is courted and flattered and told that it can do no wrong.
Its pride is pampered, its passions inflamed, its prejudices made
inveterate. Such are the processes by which other republics have
been subverted, and he must be blind who cannot trace them
among ourselves. We mean not to exaggerate our dangers. We
rejoice to know that the improvements of society oppose many
checks to the love of power. But every wise man who sees its
workings must dread it as one chief foe.</p>

<p>This passion derives strength and vehemence in our country
from the common idea that political power is the highest prize
which society has to offer. We know not a more general delusion,
nor is it the least dangerous. Instilled as it is in our
youth, it gives infinite excitement to political ambition. It turns
the active talents of the country to public station as the supreme
good, and makes it restless, intriguing, and unprincipled. It
calls out hosts of selfish competitors for comparatively few
places, and encourages a bold, unblushing pursuit of personal
elevation, which a just moral sense and self-respect in the community
would frown upon and cover with shame.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CAUSES_OF_WAR" id="THE_CAUSES_OF_WAR"></a>THE CAUSES OF WAR</h3>

<h4>From a 'Discourse delivered before the Congregational ministers of
Massachusetts'</h4>

<p>One of the great springs of war may be found in a very
strong and general propensity of human nature&mdash;in the
love of excitement, of emotion, of strong interest; a propensity
which gives a charm to those bold and hazardous enterprises
which call forth all the energies of our nature. No state
of mind, not even positive suffering, is more painful than the
want of interesting objects.  The vacant soul preys on itself, and
often rushes with impatience from the security which demands
no effort, to the brink of peril. This part of human nature is
seen in the kind of pleasures which have always been preferred.
Why has the first rank among sports been given to the chase?
Because its difficulties, hardships, hazards, tumults, awaken the
mind, and give to it a new consciousness of existence, and a
deep feeling of its powers.  What is the charm which attaches
the statesman to an office which almost weighs him down with
labor and an appalling responsibility?  He finds much of his
compensation in the powerful emotion and interest awakened by
the very hardships of his lot, by conflict with vigorous minds,
by the opposition of rivals, by the alternations of success and
defeat. What hurries to the gaming tables the man of prosperous
fortune and ample resources?  The dread of apathy, the
love of strong feeling and of mental agitation. A deeper interest
is felt in hazarding than in securing wealth, and the temptation
is irresistible.... Another powerful principle of our
nature which is the spring of war, is the passion for superiority,
for triumph, for power. The human mind is aspiring, impatient
of inferiority, and eager for control.  I need not enlarge on the
predominance of this passion in rulers, whose love of power is
influenced by its possession, and who are ever restless to extend
their sway. It is more important to observe that were this desire
restrained to the breasts of rulers, war would move with a
sluggish pace.  But the passion for power and superiority is universal;
and as every individual, from his intimate union with
the community, is accustomed to appropriate its triumphs to
himself, there is a general promptness to engage in any contest
by which the community may obtain an ascendency over other<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3517]</span>
nations. The desire that our country should surpass all others
would not be criminal, did we understand in what respects it is
most honorable for a nation to excel; did we feel that the glory
of a State consists in intellectual and moral superiority, in pre-eminence
of knowledge, freedom and purity. But to the mass
of the people this form of pre-eminence is too refined and unsubstantial.
There is another kind of triumph which they better
understand: the triumph of physical power, triumph in battle,
triumph not over the minds but the territory of another State.
Here is a palpable, visible superiority; and for this a people are
willing to submit to severe privations. A victory blots out the
memory of their sufferings, and in boasting of their extended
power they find a compensation for many woes.... Another
powerful spring of war is the admiration of the brilliant
qualities displayed in war. Many delight in war, not for its
carnage and woes, but for its valor and apparent magnanimity,
for the self-command of the hero, the fortitude which despises
suffering, the resolution which courts danger, the superiority of
the mind to the body, to sensation, to fear. Men seldom delight
in war, considered merely as a source of misery. When they
hear of battles, the picture which rises to their view is not
what it should be&mdash;a picture of extreme wretchedness, of the
wounded, the mangled, the slain; these horrors are hidden under
the splendor of those mighty energies which break forth amidst
the perils of conflict, and which human nature contemplates with
an intense and heart-thrilling delight. Whilst the peaceful sovereign
who scatters blessings with the silence and constancy of
Providence is received with a faint applause, men assemble in
crowds to hail the conqueror,&mdash;perhaps a monster in human form,
whose private life is blackened with lust and crime, and whose
greatness is built on perfidy and usurpation. Thus war is the
surest and speediest way to renown; and war will never cease
while the field of battle is the field of glory, and the most luxuriant
laurels grow from a root nourished with blood.</p>

<h3><a name="SPIRITUAL_FREEDOM" id="SPIRITUAL_FREEDOM"></a>SPIRITUAL FREEDOM</h3>

<h4>From the 'Discourse on Spiritual Freedom,' 1830</h4>

<p>I consider the freedom or moral strength of the individual
mind as the supreme good, and the highest end of government.
I am aware that other views are often taken. It is
said that government is intended for the public, for the community,
not for the individual. The idea of a national interest
prevails in the minds of statesmen, and to this it is thought that
the individual may be sacrificed. But I would maintain that the
individual is not made for the State so much as the State for
the individual. A man is not created for political relations as
his highest end, but for indefinite spiritual progress, and is
placed in political relations as the means of his progress. The
human soul is greater, more sacred than the State, and must
never be sacrificed to it. The human soul is to outlive all
earthly institutions. The distinction of nations is to pass away.
Thrones which have stood for ages are to meet the doom pronounced
upon all man's works. But the individual mind survives,
and the obscurest subject, if true to God, will rise to
power never wielded by earthly potentates.</p>

<p>A human being is a member of the community, not as a
limb is a member of the body, or as a wheel is a part of a
machine, intended only to contribute to some general joint
result. He was created not to be merged in the whole, as a
drop in the ocean or as a particle of sand on the seashore, and
to aid only in composing a mass. He is an ultimate being,
made for his own perfection as his highest end; made to maintain
an individual existence, and to serve others only as far as
consists with his own virtue and progress. Hitherto governments
have tended greatly to obscure this importance of the individual,
to depress him in his own eyes, to give him the idea of an outward
interest more important than the invisible soul, and of an
outward authority more sacred than the voice of God in his own
secret conscience. Rulers have called the private man the property
of the State, meaning generally by the State themselves;
and thus the many have been immolated to the few, and have
even believed that this was their highest destination. These
views cannot be too earnestly withstood. Nothing seems to me
so needful as to give to the mind the consciousness, which governments
have done so much to suppress, of its own separate<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3519]</span>
worth. Let the individual feel that through his immortality he
may concentrate in his own being a greater good than that of
nations. Let him feel that he is placed in the community, not
to part with his individuality or to become a tool, but that he
should find a sphere for his various powers, and a preparation
for immortal glory. To me the progress of society consists in
nothing more than in bringing out the individual, in giving him
a consciousness of his own being, and in quickening him to
strengthen and elevate his own mind.</p>

<p>In thus maintaining that the individual is the end of social
institutions, I may be thought to discourage public efforts and
the sacrifice of private interests to the State. Far from it. No
man, I affirm, will serve his fellow-beings so effectually, so fervently,
as he who is not their slave; as he who, casting off every
other yoke, subjects himself to the law of duty in his own mind.
For this law enjoins a disinterested and generous spirit, as man's
glory and likeness to his Maker. Individuality, or moral self-subsistence,
is the surest foundation of an all-comprehending love.
No man so multiplies his bonds with the community, as he who
watches most jealously over his own perfection. There is a beautiful
harmony between the good of the State and the moral freedom
and dignity of the individual. Were it not so, were these
interests in any case discordant, were an individual ever called
to serve his country by acts debasing his own mind, he ought
not to waver a moment as to the good which he should prefer.
Property, life, he should joyfully surrender to the State. But his
soul he must never stain or enslave. From poverty, pain, the
rack, the gibbet, he should not recoil; but for no good of others
ought he to part with self-control, or violate the inward law.
We speak of the patriot as sacrificing himself to the public weal.
Do we mean that he sacrifices what is most properly himself,
the principle of piety and virtue? Do we not feel that however
great may be the good which through his sufferings accrues to
the State, a greater and purer glory redounds to himself; and
that the most precious fruit of his disinterested services is the
strength of resolution and philanthropy which is accumulated in
his own soul?...</p>

<p>The advantages of civilization have their peril. In such a
state of society, opinion and law impose salutary restraint, and
produce general order and security. But the power of opinion
grows into a despotism, which more than all things represses<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3520]</span>
original and free thought, subverts individuality of character, reduces
the community to a spiritless monotony, and chills the
love of perfection. Religion, considered simply as the principle
which balances the power of human opinion, which takes man
out of the grasp of custom and fashion, and teaches him to refer
himself to a higher tribunal, is an infinite aid to moral strength
and elevation.</p>

<p>An important benefit of civilization, of which we hear much
from the political economist, is the division of labor, by which
arts are perfected. But this, by confining the mind to an
unceasing round of petty operations, tends to break it into littleness.
We possess improved fabrics, but deteriorated men.
Another advantage of civilization is, that manners are refined
and accomplishments multiplied; but these are continually seen
to supplant simplicity of character, strength of feeling, the love
of nature, the love of inward beauty and glory. Under outward
courtesy we see a cold selfishness, a spirit of calculation, and
little energy of love.</p>

<p>I confess I look round on civilized society with many fears,
and with more and more earnest desire that a regenerating spirit
from heaven, from religion, may descend upon and pervade it.
I particularly fear that various causes are acting powerfully
among ourselves, to inflame and madden that enslaving and
degrading principle, the passion for property. For example, the
absence of hereditary distinctions in our country gives prominence
to the distinction of wealth, and holds up this as the chief prize
to ambition. Add to this the epicurean, self-indulgent habits
which our prosperity has multiplied, and which crave insatiably
for enlarging wealth as the only means of gratification. This
peril is increased by the spirit of our times, which is a spirit of
commerce, industry, internal improvements, mechanical invention,
political economy, and peace. Think not that I would disparage
commerce, mechanical skill, and especially pacific connections
among States. But there is danger that these blessings may by
perversion issue in a slavish love of lucre. It seems to me that
some of the objects which once moved men most powerfully are
gradually losing their sway, and thus the mind is left more open
to the excitement of wealth. For example, military distinction is
taking the inferior place which it deserves: and the consequence
will be that the energy and ambition which have been exhausted
in war will seek new directions; and happy shall we be if they<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3521]</span>
do not flow into the channel of gain. So I think that political
eminence is to be less and less coveted; and there is danger that
the energies absorbed by it will be spent in seeking another
kind of dominion, the dominion of property. And if such be the
result, what shall we gain by what is called the progress of
society? What shall we gain by national peace, if men, instead
of meeting on the field of battle, wage with one another the
more inglorious strife of dishonest and rapacious traffic? What
shall we gain by the waning of political ambition, if the intrigues
of the exchange take place of those of the cabinet, and private
pomp and luxury be substituted for the splendor of public life?
I am no foe to civilization. I rejoice in its progress. But I
mean to say that without a pure religion to modify its tendencies,
to inspire and refine it, we shall be corrupted, not ennobled by
it. It is the excellence of the religious principle, that it aids
and carries forward civilization, extends science and arts, multiplies
the conveniences and ornaments of life, and at the same
time spoils them of their enslaving power, and even converts
them into means and ministers of that spiritual freedom which
when left to themselves they endanger and destroy.</p>

<p>In order, however, that religion should yield its full and best
fruit, one thing is necessary; and the times require that I should
state it with great distinctness. It is necessary that religion
should be held and professed in a liberal spirit. Just as far as
it assumes an intolerant, exclusive, sectarian form, it subverts
instead of strengthening the soul's freedom, and becomes the
heaviest and most galling yoke which is laid on the intellect and
conscience. Religion must be viewed, not as a monopoly of
priests, ministers, or sects, not as conferring on any man a right
to dictate to his fellow-beings, not as an instrument by which
the few may awe the many, not as bestowing on one a prerogative
which is not enjoyed by all; but as the property of every
human being and as the great subject for every human mind.
It must be regarded as the revelation of a common Father to
whom all have equal access, who invites all to the like immediate
communion, who has no favorites, who has appointed no
infallible expounders of his will, who opens his works and word
to every eye, and calls upon all to read for themselves, and to
follow fearlessly the best convictions of their own understandings.
Let religion be seized on by individuals or sects, as their special
province; let them clothe themselves with God's prerogative<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3522]</span>
of judgment; let them succeed in enforcing their creed by penalties
of law, or penalties of opinion; let them succeed in fixing a
brand on virtuous men whose only crime is free investigation&mdash;and
religion becomes the most blighting tyranny which can
establish itself over the mind. You have all heard of the outward
evils which religion, when thus turned into tyranny, has
inflicted; how it has dug dreary dungeons, kindled fires for the
martyr, and invented instruments of exquisite torture. But to
me all this is less fearful than its influence over the mind.
When I see the superstitions which it has fastened on the conscience,
the spiritual terrors with which it has haunted and
subdued the ignorant and susceptible, the dark appalling views
of God which it has spread far and wide, the dread of inquiry
which it has struck into superior understandings, and the servility
of spirit which it has made to pass for piety&mdash;when I see
all this, the fire, the scaffold, and the outward inquisition, terrible
as they are, seem to me inferior evils. I look with a solemn
joy on the heroic spirits who have met, freely and fearlessly, pain
and death in the cause of truth and human rights. But there
are other victims of intolerance on whom I look with unmixed
sorrow. They are those who, spell-bound by early prejudice or
by intimidations from the pulpit and the press, dare not think;
who anxiously stifle every doubt or misgiving in regard to their
opinions, as if to doubt were a crime; who shrink from the
seekers after truth as from infection; who deny all virtue which
does not wear the livery of their own sect; who, surrendering to
others their best powers, receive unresistingly a teaching which
wars against reason and conscience; and who think it a merit to
impose on such as live within their influence, the grievous
bondage which they bear themselves. How much to be deplored
is it, that religion, the very principle which is designed to raise
men above the judgment and power of man, should become the
chief instrument of usurpation over the soul!</p>

<h2><a name="GEORGE_CHAPMAN" id="GEORGE_CHAPMAN"></a>GEORGE CHAPMAN</h2>

<h4>(1559?-1634)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capg.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="G" title="G" />
</div><p class="dropcap">eorge Chapman, the translator of Homer, is of all the Elizabethan
dramatists the most undramatic. He is akin to
Marlowe in being more of an epic poet than a playwright;
but unlike his young compeer "of the mighty line," who in his successive
plays learnt how to subdue an essentially epic genius to the
demands of the stage, Chapman never got near the true secret of
dramatic composition. Yet he witnessed the growth of the glorious
Elizabethan drama, from its feeble beginning in 'Gorbodue' and
'Gammer Gurton's Needle' through its
very flowering in the immortal masterpieces.
He was born about 1559, five years
before Marlowe, the "morning star" of the
English drama, and he died in 1634, surviving
Shakespeare, in whom it reached its
maturity, and Beaumont, Middleton, and
Fletcher, whose works foreshadow decay.
From his native town Hitchin he passed
on to Oxford, where he distinguished himself
as a classical scholar. Then for sixteen
years nothing definite is known about
him. His life has been called one of the
great blanks of English literature. He is
sometimes sent traveling on the Continent,
as a convenient means of accounting for this gap, and also to explain
the intimate acquaintance with German manners and customs and
the language displayed in his tragedy 'Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany,'
which argues at least for a trip to that country. In 1594 he
published the two hymns in the 'Shadow of Night'; and soon after
he must have begun writing for the stage, for his first extant
comedy, 'The Blind Beggar of Alexandria,' was acted in 1596, and
two years later he appears in Francis Meres's famous enumeration of
the poets and wits of the time. Hereafter his life is to be dated by
his publications.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">George Chapman</span></span>
</div>

<p>He occupies a position unique among the Elizabethans, because
of his wide culture and the diverse character of his work. Though
held together by his strong personality, it yet can be divided into
the distinct groups of comedies, tragedies, poems, and translations.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3524]</span>
The first of these is the weakest, for Chapman was not a comic
genius. 'The Blind Beggar of Alexandria' and 'An Humorous Day's
Mirth' deserve but a passing mention. In 1605 'All Fooles' was
published, acted six years earlier under the name 'The World
Runs on Wheels.' It is a realistic satire, with some good scenes and
character-drawing. 'The Gentleman Usher' is full of poetry and
ingenious situations. 'Monsieur D'Oline' contains also some good
comedy work. 'The Widow's Tears' tells the well-known story of
the Ephesian matron; though coarse, it is handled not without comic
talent. In his comedy work Chapman is neither new nor original;
he followed in Jonson's footsteps, and suggests moreover Terence,
Plautus, Fletcher, and Lyly. He has wit, satire, and sarcasm; but
along with these, poor construction and little invention. He was
going against his grain, and we have here the frankest expression of
"pot-boiling" to be found among the Elizabethan dramatists. Writing
for the stage was the only kind of literature that really paid; the
playhouse was to the Elizabethan what the paper-covered novel is to
a modern reader. This accounts for the enormous dramatic productivity
of the time, and also explains why the most finely endowed
minds, in need of money, produced dramas instead of other imaginative
work. By the time he wrote his comedies, Chapman had
already won his place as poet and translator, but it earned him no
income. Pope, one hundred and twenty-five years later, made a fortune
by his translation of Homer. But then the number of readers
had increased, and publishers could afford to give large sums to a
popular author. Chapman takes rank among the dramatists mainly
by his four chief tragedies: 'Bussy d'Ambois,' 'The Revenge of
Bussy d'Ambois,' 'The Conspiracy of Charles, Duke of Byron,' and
'The Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron.' They are unique among
the plays of the period, in that they deal with almost contemporary
events in French history; not with the purpose of exciting any feeling
for or against the parties introduced, but in calm ignoring of
public opinion, they bring recent happenings on the stage to suit the
dramatist's purpose. He drew his material mainly from the 'Histori&aelig;
Sui Temporis' of Jacques Auguste de Thou, but he troubled himself
little about following it with accuracy, or even painting the
characters of the chief actors as true to life. In these tragedies,
more than in the comedies, we get sight of Chapman the man;
indeed, it is his great failing as playwright that his own individuality
is constantly cropping out. He alone, of all the great Elizabethan
dramatists, was unable to go outside of himself and enter into the
habits and thoughts of his characters. Chapman was too much of a
scholar and a thinker to be a successful delineator of men. His is the
drama of the man who thinks about life, not of one who lives it in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3525]</span>
its fullness. He does not get into the hearts of men. He has too
many theories. Homer had become the ruling influence in his life,
and he looked at things from the Homeric point of view and presented
life epically. He is at his best in single didactic or narrative passages,
and exquisite bits of poetry are prodigally scattered up and
down the pages of his tragedies. Next to Shakespeare he is the
most sententious of dramatists. He sounded the depths of things in
thought which theretofore only Marlowe had done. He is the most
metaphysical of dramatists.</p>

<p>Yet his thought is sometimes too much for him, and he becomes
obscure. He packs words as tight as Browning, and the sense is
often more difficult to unravel. He is best in the closet drama.
'C&aelig;sar and Pompey,' published in 1631 but never acted, contains
some of his finest thoughts.</p>

<p>Chapman also collaborated with other dramatists. 'Eastward Ho,'
in 1605, written with Marston and Jonson, is one of the liveliest and
best constructed Elizabethan comedies, combining the excellences of
the three men without their faults. Some allusion to the Scottish
nation offended King James; the authors were confined in Fleet
Prison and barely escaped having their ears and noses slit. With
Shirley he wrote the comedy 'The Ball' and the tragedy 'Chabot,
Admiral of France.'</p>

<p>Chapman wrote comedies to make money, and tragedies because
it was the fashion of the day, and he studded these latter with
exquisite passages because he was a poet born. But he was above
all a scholar with wide and deep learning, not only of the classics
but also of the Renaissance literature. From 1613 to 1631 he does
not appear to have written for the stage, but was occupied with his
translations of Homer, Hesiod, Juvenal, Mus&aelig;us, Petrarch, and others.
In 1614, at the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth, was performed
in the most lavish manner the 'Memorable Masque of the two Honorable
Houses or Inns of Court; the Middle Temple and Lyncoln
Inne.' Chapman also completed Marlowe's unfinished 'Hero and
Leander.'</p>

<p>His fame however rests on his version of Homer. The first
portion appeared in 1598: 'Seven Bookes of the Iliade of Homer,
Prince of Poets; Translated according to the Greeke in judgment of
his best Commentaries.' In 1611 the Iliad complete appeared, and
in 1615 the whole of the Odyssey; though he by no means reproduces
Homer faithfully, he approaches nearest to the original in spirit and
grandeur. It is a typical product of the English Renaissance, full of
vigor and passion, but also of conceit and fancifulness. It lacks the
simplicity and the serenity of the Greek, but has caught its nobleness
and rapidity. As has been said, "It is what Homer might have<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3526]</span>
written before he came to years of discretion." Yet with all its
shortcomings it remains one of the classics of Elizabethan literature.
Pope consulted it diligently, and has been accused of at times re-versifying
this instead of the Greek. Coleridge said of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Iliad is fine, but less equal in the translation [than the Odyssey], as
well as less interesting in itself. What is stupidly said of Shakespeare is
really true and appropriate of Chapman: 'Mighty faults counterpoised by
mighty beauties.' ... It is as truly an original poem as the 'Faerie
Queen';&mdash;it will give you small idea of Homer, though a far truer one than
Pope's epigrams, or Cowper's cumbersome, most anti-Homeric Miltonisms.
For Chapman writes and feels as a poet,&mdash;as Homer might have written had
he lived in England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In short, it is an
exquisite poem in spite of its frequent and perverse quaintnesses and awkwardness,
which are however amply repaid by almost unexampled sweetness
and beauty of language, all over spirit and feeling."</p></div>

<p>Keats's tribute, the sonnet 'On First Looking into Chapman's
Homer,' attests another poet's appreciation of the Elizabethan's paraphrase.
Keats diligently explored this "new planet" that swam
into his ken, and his own poetical diction is at times touched by the
quaintness and fancifulness of the elder poet he admired.</p>

<p>Lamb, that most sympathetic critic of the old dramatists, speaks
of him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Webster has happily characterized the 'full and heightened' style of
Chapman, who of all the English play-writers perhaps approaches nearest to
Shakespeare in the descriptive and didactic, in passages which are less purely
dramatic. He could not go out of himself, as Shakespeare could shift at
pleasure, to inform and animate other existences, but in himself he had an
eye to perceive and a soul to embrace all forms and modes of being. He
would have made a great epic poet, if indeed he has not abundantly shown
himself to be one; for his 'Homer' is not so properly a translation as the
stories of Achilles and Ulysses rewritten. The earnestness and passion which
he has put into every part of these poems would be incredible to a reader
of more modern translations.... The great obstacle to Chapman's translations
being read is their unconquerable quaintness. He pours out in the
same breath the most just and natural, and the most violent and crude
expressions. He seems to grasp at whatever words come first to hand while
the enthusiasm is upon him, as if all others must be inadequate to the divine
meaning. But passion (the all-in-all in poetry) is everywhere present, raising
the low, dignifying the mean, and putting sense into the absurd. He makes
his readers glow, weep, tremble, take any affection which he pleases, be
moved by words, or in spite of them be disgusted and overcome their disgust."</p></div>

<span class="i0">Her mother set at fire, who had to spin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rock, whose tincture with sea-purple shined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her maids about her. But she chanced to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her father going abroad, to council call'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his grave Senate; and to him exhaled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her smother'd bosom was:&mdash;"Loved sire," said she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Will you not now command a coach for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stately and complete? fit for me to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wash at flood the weeds I cannot wear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their states in marriage; and who else but I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sister, should their dancing rites supply?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This general cause she shew'd, and would not name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mind of nuptials to her sire, for shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He understood her yet, and thus replied:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Daughter! nor these, nor any grace beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I either will deny thee, or defer,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">The servants then commanded soon obey'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fetch'd coach, and mules join'd in it. Then the Maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought from the chamber her rich weeds, and laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All up in coach; in which her mother placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maund of victuals, varied well in taste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other junkets. Wine she likewise fill'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within a goat-skin bottle, and distill'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet and moist oil into a golden cruse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both for her daughter's and her handmaid's use,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nausicaa scourged to make the coach-mules run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That neigh'd, and paced their usual speed, and soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both maids and weeds brought to the river-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where baths for all the year their use supplied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose waters were so pure they would not stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still ran fair forth; and did more remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apt to purge stains, for that purged stain within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which by the water's pure store was not seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">These, here arrived, the mules uncoach'd, and drave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up the gulfy river's shore, that gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet grass to them. The maids from coach then took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their clothes, and steep'd them in the sable brook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then put them into springs, and trod them clean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cleanly feet; adventuring wagers then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who should have soonest and most cleanly done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When having thoroughly cleansed, they spread them on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flood's shore, all in order. And then, where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves the pebbles wash'd, and ground was clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bathed themselves, and all with glittering oil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth'd their white skins; refreshing then their toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pleasant dinner, by the river's side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still watch'd when the sun their clothes had dried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till which time, having dined, Nausicaa<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With other virgins did at stool-ball play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shoulder-reaching head-tires laying by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nausicaa, with the wrists of ivory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The liking stroke strook, singing first a song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As custom order'd, and amidst the throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made such a shew, and so past all was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the chaste-born, arrow-loving Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the mountains gliding, either over<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Might easily judge whom her pains brought to light;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ordering their weeds; disorder'd as they play'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mules and coach ready, then Minerva thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What means to wake Ulysses might be wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he might see this lovely-sighted maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom she intended should become his aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring him to town, and his return advance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mean was this, though thought a stool-ball chance:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen now, for the upstroke, strook the ball<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite wide off th' other maids, and made it fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the whirlpools. At which outshriek'd all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the shriek did wise Ulysses wake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, sitting up, was doubtful who should make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sudden outcry, and in mind thus strived:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"On what a people am I now arrived?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At civil hospitable men, that fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods? or dwell injurious mortals here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unjust and churlish? Like the female cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of youth it sounds. What are they? Nymphs bred high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On tops of hills, or in the founts of floods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In herby marshes, or in leavy woods?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or are they high-spoke men I now am near?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll prove and see." With this the wary peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept forth the thicket, and an olive bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke with his broad hand; which he did bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In covert of his nakedness, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put hasty head out. Look how from his den<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mountain lion looks, that, all embrued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With drops of trees, and weatherbeaten-hued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold of his strength goes on, and in his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A burning furnace glows, all bent to prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On sheep, or oxen, or the upland hart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His belly charging him, and he must part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stakes with the herdsman in his beasts' attempt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even where from rape their strengths are most exempt:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So wet, so weather-beat, so stung with need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to the home-fields of the country's breed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses was to force forth his access,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though merely naked; and his sight did press<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eyes of soft-haired virgins. Horrid was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rough appearance to them; the hard pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had at sea stuck by him. All in flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The virgins scattered, frighted with this sight,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3530]</span><span class="i0">About the prominent windings of the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but Nausicaa fled; but she fast stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas had put a boldness in her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her fair limbs tender fear comprest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still she stood him, as resolved to know<br /></span>

for the Church, he became a pronounced skeptic, and entered the
army. In his nineteenth year he was presented at court, and became
acquainted with men of letters like La
Harpe, Le Brun, and Fontanes. At the
outbreak of the Revolution he quitted the
service, and embarked for America in January,
1791. Tiring of the restraints of
civilization, civilization, he plunged into the virgin
forests of Canada, and for several months
lived with the savages. This remarkable
experience inspired his most notable romantic
work.</p>

</div>

<p>Returning to France in 1792, he cast his
lot with the Royalists, was wounded at
Thionville, and finally retired to England,
where for eight years he earned a bare support
by teaching and translating. His first book was the 'Essay on
Revolutions' (1797), which displayed some imagination, little reflection,
and an affectation of misanthropy and skepticism. The subsequent
change in his convictions followed on the death of his pious
mother in 1798. Returning to France he published 'Atala,' an idyll
<i>&aacute; la mode</i>, founded on the loves of two young savages. Teeming
with glowing descriptions of nature, and marked by elevation of
sentiment combined with a sensuousness almost Oriental, this barbaric
'Paul and Virginia' immediately established the author's fame.
Thus encouraged, in the following year he gave the world his
'Genius of Christianity,' in which the poetic and symbolic features of
Christianity are painted in dazzling colors and with great charm of
style. The enormous success of this book during the first decade of
the century unquestionably did more to revive French interest in
religion than the establishment of the Concordat itself. Napoleon
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3532]</span>testified his gratitude by appointing the author secretary to the embassy
at Rome, and afterward minister plenipotentiary to the Valais.
When the Duke d'Enghien was assassinated (March 21st, 1804), Ch&acirc;teaubriand
resigned from the diplomatic service, although the ink
was scarcely dry in which the First Consul had signed his new commission.
Two years later the successful author departed on a sentimental
pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He visited Asia Minor, Egypt,
and Spain, where amid the ruins of the Alhambra he wrote 'The
Last of the Abencerrages.' To this interesting tour the world owes
the 'Itinerary from Paris to Jerusalem' (1811), that book which in
Saintsbury's opinion remains "the pattern of all the picturesque
travels of modern times."</p>

<p>With the publication of the 'Itinerary' the literary career of
Ch&acirc;teaubriand virtually closes. On the return of the Bourbons to
power, the man of letters was tempted to enter the exciting arena
of politics, becoming successively ambassador at Berlin, at the court
of St. James, delegate to the Congress of Verona, and Minister of
Foreign Affairs. In 1830, unwilling to pledge himself to Louis
Philippe, he relinquished the dignity of peer of the realm accorded
him in 1815, and retired to a life of comparative poverty, which was
brightened by the friendship and devotion of Madame R&eacute;camier.
Until his death on the 4th of July, 1848, Ch&acirc;teaubriand devoted
himself to the completion of his 'M&eacute;moires d'Outre-Tombe,' an auto-biographical
work which was published posthumously, and which,
although diffuse and even puerile at times, contains much brilliant
writing.</p>

<p>His contemporaries pronounced Ch&acirc;teaubriand the foremost man
of letters of France, if not of all Europe. During the last half of
this century his fame has sensibly diminished both at home and
abroad, and in the history of French literature he is chiefly significant
as marking the transition from the old classical to the modern
romantic school. Yet while admitting the glaring faults, exaggerations,
affectations, and egotism of the author of the 'Genius of
Christianity,' a fair criticism admits his best passages to be unsurpassed
for perfection of style and gorgeousness of coloring. 'Atala'
is a classic with real life in it even yet,&mdash;powerful, interesting, and
even thrilling, in spite of its theatricality, and often magnificent in
description.</p>

<p>In 1811 Ch&acirc;teaubriand was elected to the French Academy as
the successor of the poet Ch&eacute;nier. Among his works not already
mentioned are 'Ren&eacute;' (1807), a sort of sequel to 'Atala'; 'The Martyrs'
(1810); 'The Natchez' (1826), containing recollections of America;
an 'Essay on English Literature' (2 vols.); and a translation of
Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (1836).</p>

<h3><a name="CHRISTIANITY_VINDICATED" id="CHRISTIANITY_VINDICATED"></a>CHRISTIANITY VINDICATED</h3>

<h4>From 'The Genius of Christianity'</h4>

<p>During the reign of the Emperor Julian commenced a persecution,
perhaps more dangerous than violence itself, which
consisted in loading the Christians with disgrace and contempt.
Julian began his hostility by plundering the churches;
he then forbade the faithful to teach or to study the liberal arts
and sciences. Sensible, however, of the important advantages of
the institutions of Christianity, the emperor determined to establish
hospitals and monasteries, and after the example of the
gospel system to combine morality with religion; he ordered a
kind of sermons to be delivered in the pagan temples....</p>

<p>From the time of Julian to that of Luther, the Church, flourishing
in full vigor, had no occasion for apologists; but when
the Western schism took place, with new enemies arose new
defenders. It cannot be denied that at first the Protestants had
the superiority, at least in regard to forms, as Montesquieu has
remarked. Erasmus himself was weak when opposed to Luther,
and Theodore Beza had a captivating manner of writing, in
which his opponents were too often deficient....</p>

<p>It is natural for schism to lead to infidelity, and for heresy to
engender atheism. Bayle and Spinoza arose after Calvin, and
they found in Clarke and Leibnitz men of sufficient talents to
refute their sophistry. Abbadie wrote an apology for religion,
remarkable for method and sound argument. Unfortunately his
style is feeble, though his ideas are not destitute of brilliancy.
"If the ancient philosophers," observes Abbadie, "adored the
Virtues, their worship was only a beautiful species of idolatry."</p>

<p>While the Church was yet enjoying her triumph, Voltaire
renewed the persecution of Julian. He possessed the baneful
art of making infidelity fashionable among a capricious but
amiable people. Every species of self-love was pressed into this
insensate league. Religion was attacked with every kind of
weapon, from the pamphlet to the folio, from the epigram to the
sophism. No sooner did a religious book appear than the author
was overwhelmed with ridicule, while works which Voltaire was
the first to laugh at among his friends were extolled to the
skies. Such was his superiority over his disciples that he sometimes
could not forbear diverting himself with their irreligious<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3534]</span>
enthusiasm. Meanwhile the destructive system continued to
spread throughout France. It was first adopted in those provincial
academies, each of which was a focus of bad taste and faction.
Women of fashion and grave philosophers alike read
lectures on infidelity. It was at length concluded that Christianity
was no better than a barbarous system, and that its fall
could not happen too soon for the liberty of mankind, the promotion
of knowledge, the improvement of the arts, and the general
comfort of life.</p>

<p>To say nothing of the abyss into which we were plunged by
this aversion to the religion of the gospel, its immediate consequence
was a return, more affected than sincere, to that mythology
of Greece and Rome to which all the wonders of antiquity
were ascribed. People were not ashamed to regret that worship
which had transformed mankind into a herd of madmen, monsters
of indecency, or ferocious beasts. This could not fail to
inspire contempt for the writers of the age of Louis XIV., who
however had reached the high perfection which distinguished
them only by being religious. If no one ventured to oppose
them face to face, on account of their firmly established reputation,
they were nevertheless attacked in a thousand indirect
ways. It was asserted that they were unbelievers <i>in their hearts</i>;
or at least that they would have been much greater characters
had they lived <i>in our times</i>. Every author blessed his good
fortune for having been born in the glorious age of the Diderots
and d'Alemberts, in that age when all the attainments of the
human mind were ranged in alphabetical order in the 'Encyclop&eacute;die,'
that Babel of the sciences and of reason....</p>

<p>It was therefore necessary to prove that on the contrary the
Christian religion, of all the religions that ever existed, is the
most humane, the most favorable to liberty and to the arts and
sciences; that the modern world is indebted to it for every
improvement from agriculture to the abstract sciences, from the
hospitals for the reception of the unfortunate to the temples
reared by the Michael Angelos and embellished by the Raphaels.
It was necessary to prove that nothing is more divine than its
morality, nothing more lovely and more sublime than its tenets,
its doctrine, and its worship; that it encourages genius, corrects
the taste, develops the virtuous passions, imparts energy to the
ideas, presents noble images to the writer, and perfect models
to the artist; that there is no disgrace in being believers with<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3535]</span>
Newton and Bossuet, with Pascal and Racine. In a word, it was
necessary to summon all the charms of the imagination and all
the interests of the heart to the assistance of that religion
against which they had been set in array.</p>

<p>The reader may now have a clear view of the object of our
work. All other kinds of apologies are exhausted, and perhaps
they would be useless at the present day. Who would now sit
down to read a work professedly theological? Possibly a few
sincere Christians who are already convinced. But, it may be
asked, May there not be some danger in considering religion in
a merely human point of view? Why so? Does our religion
shrink from the light? Surely one great proof of its divine
origin is, that it will bear the test of the fullest and severest
scrutiny of reason. Would you have us always open to the
reproach of enveloping our tenets in sacred obscurity, lest their
falsehood should be detected? Will Christianity be the less true
for appearing the more beautiful? Let us banish our weak
apprehensions; let us not, by an excess of religion, leave religion
to perish. We no longer live in those times when you might
say, "Believe without inquiring." People <i>will</i> inquire in spite
of us; and our timid silence, in heightening the triumph of the
infidel, will diminish the number of believers.</p>

<p>It is time that the world should know to what all those
charges of absurdity, vulgarity, and meanness, that are daily
alleged against Christianity, may be reduced. It is time to
demonstrate that instead of debasing the ideas, it encourages
the soul to take the most daring flights, and is capable of
enchanting the imagination as divinely as the deities of Homer
and Virgil. Our arguments will at least have this advantage,
that they will be intelligible to the world at large and will
require nothing but common-sense to determine their weight and
strength. In works of this kind authors neglect, perhaps rather
too much, to speak the language of their readers. It is necessary
to be a scholar with a scholar, and a poet with a poet. The
Almighty does not forbid us to tread the flowery path, if it
serves to lead the wanderer once more to him; nor is it always
by the steep and rugged mountain that the lost sheep finds its
way back to the fold.</p>

<p>We think that this mode of considering Christianity displays
associations of ideas which are but imperfectly known. Sublime
in the antiquity of its recollections, which go back to the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3536]</span>
creation of the world; ineffable in its mysteries, adorable in its
sacraments, interesting in its history, celestial in its morality,
rich and attractive in its ceremonial,&mdash;it is fraught with every species
of beauty. Would you follow it in poetry? Tasso, Milton,
Corneille, Racine, Voltaire, will depict to you its miraculous
effects. In belles-lettres, in oratory, history, and philosophy,
what have not Bossuet, F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, Massillon, Bourdaloue, Bacon,
Pascal, Euler, Newton, Leibnitz, produced by its inspiration!
In the arts, what masterpieces! If you examine it in its worship,
what ideas are suggested by its antique Gothic churches,
its admirable prayers, its impressive ceremonies! Among its
clergy, behold all those scholars who have handed down to you
the languages and the works of Greece and Rome; all those
anchorets of Thebais; all those asylums for the unfortunate; all
those missionaries to China, to Canada, to Paraguay; not forgetting
the military orders whence chivalry derived its origin.
Everything has been engaged in our cause&mdash;the manners of our
ancestors, the pictures of days of yore, poetry, even romances
themselves. We have called smiles from the cradle, and tears
from the tomb. Sometimes, with the Maronite monk, we dwell
on the summits of Carmel and Lebanon; at others we watch
with the Daughter of Charity at the bedside of the sick. Here
two American lovers summon us into the recesses of their deserts;
there we listen to the sighs of the virgin in the solitude of
the cloister. Homer takes his place by Milton, and Virgil beside
Tasso; the ruins of Athens and of Memphis form contrasts with
the ruins of Christian monuments, and the tombs of Ossian with
our rural churchyards. At St. Denis we visit the ashes of kings;
and when our subject requires us to treat of the existence of
God, we seek our proofs in the wonders of Nature alone. In
short, we endeavor to strike the heart of the infidel in every
possible way; but we dare not flatter ourselves that we possess
the miraculous rod of religion which caused living streams to
burst from the flinty rock.</p>

<h3><a name="DESCRIPTION_OF_A_THUNDER-STORM_IN_THE_FOREST" id="DESCRIPTION_OF_A_THUNDER-STORM_IN_THE_FOREST"></a>DESCRIPTION OF A THUNDER-STORM IN THE FOREST</h3>

<h4>From 'Atala'</h4>

<p>It was the twenty-seventh sun since our departure from the
Cabins: the <i>lune de fer</i> (month of July) had commenced its
course, and all signs indicated the approach of a violent
storm. Toward the hour when the Indian matrons hang up the
plowshares on the branches of the junipers, and when the paroquets
retire into the hollows of the cypress trees, the sky grew
overcast. The vague sounds of solitude gradually ceased, the
forests were wrapped in universal calm. Suddenly the pealing
of distant thunder, re-echoing through these vast woods as old as
the world itself, startled the ear with a diapason of noises
sublime. Fearing to be overwhelmed in the flood, we hastily
disembarked on the river's bank and sought safety in the seclusion
of one of the forest glades.</p>

<p>The ground was swampy. We pressed forward with difficulty
beneath a roof of smilax, among grape-vines and climbing plants
of all kinds, in which our feet were continually entangled. The
spongy soil trembled all around us, and every instant we were
on the verge of being engulfed in the quagmires. Swarms of
insects and enormous bats nearly blinded us; rattlesnakes were
heard on all sides; and the wolves, bears, panthers, and badgers
which had sought a refuge in this retreat filled the air with
their roarings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the obscurity increased; the lowering clouds entered
beneath the shadows of the trees. The heavens were rent,
and the lightning traced a flashing zigzag of fire. A furious
gale from the west piled up the angry clouds in heavy masses;
the mighty trees bowed their heads to the blast. Again and
again the sky was rent, and through the yawning crevices one
beheld new heavens and vales of fire. What an awful, what a
magnificent spectacle! The trees were struck by lightning and
ignited; the conflagration spread like a flaming garland; the
showers of sparks and the columns of smoke ascended to the
very heavens, which vomited their thunders into the sea of fire.</p>

<p>Then the Great Spirit enveloped the mountains in utter darkness;
from the midst of this vast chaos came a confused roaring
made by the tumult of many winds, the moaning of the trees,
the howlings of ferocious beasts, the crackling of the flames,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3538]</span>
and the descent of balls of fire which hissed as they were extinguished
in the water.</p>

<p>The Great Spirit knows the truth of what I now say! At
this moment I saw only Atala, I had no thought but for her.
Beneath the bent trunk of a birch-tree, I succeeded in protecting
her from the torrents of rain. Seated myself under the
tree, supporting my well-beloved on my knees, and chafing her
bare feet between my hands, I was even happier than the
young wife who feels for the first time the consciousness of her
motherhood.</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_CHATTERTON" id="THOMAS_CHATTERTON"></a>THOMAS CHATTERTON</h2>

<h4>(1752-1770)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">o the third quarter of the eighteenth century belongs the
tragedy of the life of Thomas Chatterton, who, misunderstood
and neglected during his brief seventeen years of
poetic revery, has by the force of his genius and by his actual
achievement compelled the nineteenth century, through one of its
best critics, to acknowledge him as the father of the New Romantic
school, and to accord him thereby a place unique among his contemporaries.
His family and early surroundings serve in a way to
explain his development. He was born at
Bristol, a town rich in the traditions and
monuments of bygone times. For nearly
two hundred years the office of sexton to
the church of St. Mary Redcliffe had been
handed down in the family. At the time
of the poet's birth it was held by a maternal
uncle; for his father, a "musical genius,
somewhat of a poet, an antiquary and dabbler
in occult arts," was the first to aspire
to a position above the hereditary one, and
had taken charge of the Pyle free schools
in Bristol. He died before his son's birth,
and left his widow to support her two
children by keeping a little school and by
needlework. The boy, reserved and given to revery from his earliest
years, was at first considered dull, but finally learned to spell by
means of the illuminated capitals of an old musical folio and a black-letter
Bible. He spent much of his time with his uncle, in and
about the church. St. Mary Redcliffe, one of the finest specimens of
medi&aelig;val church architecture in England, is especially rich in altar
tombs with recumbent carved figures of knights, and ecclesiastic and
civic dignitaries of bygone days. These became the boy's familiar
associates, and he amused himself on his lonely visits by spelling out
the old inscriptions on their monuments. There he got hold of some
quaint oaken chests in the muniment room over the porch, filled
with parchments old as the Wars of the Roses, and these deeds and
charters of the Henrys and Edwards became his primers. In 1760 he
entered Colston's "Blue-Coat" charity school, located in a fine old<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3540]</span>
building of the Tudor times. The rules of the institution provided
for the training of its inmates "in the principles of the Christian
religion as laid down in the Church catechism," and in fitting them
to be apprenticed in due course to some trade. During the six years
of his stay, Chatterton received only the rudiments of a common-school
education, and found little to nourish his genius. But being
a voracious reader, he went on his small allowance through three
circulating libraries, and became acquainted with the older English
poets, and also read history and antiquities. He very early entertained
dreams of ambition, without however finding any sympathy;
so he lived in a world of his own, conceiving before the age of
twelve the romance of Thomas Rowley, an imaginary clerk of the
fifteenth century, and his patron Master William Canynge, a former
mayor of Bristol whose effigy was familiar to him from the tomb in
the church. This fiction, which after his death gave rise to the celebrated
controversy of the 'Rowley Poems,' matured at this early
age as a boy's life-dream, he fashioned into a consistent romance,
and wove into it among the prose fragments the ballads and lyrics
on which his fame as poet now rests. His earliest literary forgery
was a practical joke played on a credulous pewterer at Bristol, for
whom he fabricated a pedigree dating back to the time of the Norman
Conquest, which he professed to have collected from ancient
manuscripts. It is remarkable as the work of a boy not yet fourteen.
He was rewarded with a crown piece, and the success of this
hoax encouraged him further to play upon the credulity of his
townspeople, and to continue writing prose and verse in pseudo-antique
style.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">
<img src="images/chatterton.jpg" width="168" height="199" alt="Thomas Chatterton" title="Thomas Chatterton" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thomas Chatterton</span></span>
</div>

<p>In 1767 he was bound apprentice to John Lambert, attorney. The
office duties were light. He spent his spare time in poetizing, and
sent anonymously transcripts from professedly old poems to the local
papers. Their authorship being traced to him, he now claimed that
his father had found numerous old poems and other manuscripts
in a coffer of the muniment room at Redcliffe, and that he had transcribed
them. Under guise of this fiction he produced, within the
two years of his apprenticeship, a mass of pseudo-antique dramatic,
lyric, and descriptive poems, and fragments of local and general history,
connected all with his romance of the clerk of Bristol. A
scholarly knowledge of Middle English was rare one hundred and
thirty years ago, and the self-taught boy easily gulled the local antiquaries.
He even deceived Horace Walpole, who, dabbling in medi&aelig;valism,
had opened the way for prose romances with his 'Castle
of Otranto,' a spurious antique of the same time in which Chatterton
had placed his fiction. Walpole at first treated him courteously,
even offering to print some of the poems. But when Gray and Mason<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3541]</span>
pronounced them modern, he at once gave Chatterton the cold shoulder,
entirely forgetting his own imposition on a credulous public.</p>

<p>Chatterton now turned to periodical literature and the politics of
the day, and began to contribute to various London magazines. In
the spring of 1770 he finally came up to London, to start on the life
of a literary adventurer on a capital of less than five pounds. He
lived abstemiously and worked incessantly, literally day and night.
He had a wonderful versatility; he would write in the manner of any
one he chose to imitate, and he tried his hand at every species of
book-work. But even under the strain of this incessant productivity
he found time to turn back to his boyhood dreams, and produced
one of his finest poems, the 'Ballad of Charity.' At first his contributions
were freely accepted, but he was poorly paid, and sometimes
not at all. Yet out of his scanty earnings he bought costly presents
for his mother and sister, as tokens of affection and an earnest of
what he hoped to do for them. After scarcely two months in London
he was at the end of his resources. He made an attempt to
gain a position as surgeon's assistant on board of an African trader,
but was unsuccessful. He now found himself face to face with
famine; and, too proud to ask for assistance or to accept even the
hospitality of a single meal, he on the night of August 25th, 1770,
locked himself into his garret, destroyed all his note-books and
papers, and swallowed a dose of arsenic. It is believed that he was
privately buried in the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliffe. There a
monument has been erected, with an inscription from his poem
'Will':&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the memory of Thomas Chatterton. Reader! judge not. If thou art
a Christian, believe that he shall be judged by a superior power. To that
power alone is he now answerable."</p></div>

<p>His death attracted little notice, for he was regarded merely as
the transcriber of the 'Rowley' poems. They were collected after
his death, from the various persons to whom he had given the manuscripts,
and occasioned a controversy that has lasted almost down
to the present generation. But only an age untrained in philological
research could ever have received them as genuine productions of
the fifteenth century: for Chatterton, who knew little of the old
authors antedating Spenser, constructed with the help of Bailey's and
Kersey's English dictionaries a lingo of his own; he strung together
old words of all periods and dialects, and even coined words himself
to suit the metre. His lingo resembles anything rather than Middle
English. It is supposed that he wrote first in modern English, and
then translated into his own dialect; for the poems do not suffer by
retranslation,&mdash;on the contrary, they are more intelligible and often<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3542]</span>
more rhythmical. Chatterton had a wonderful memory, and having
read enormously, there are frequent though perhaps unconscious
plagiarisms from Spenser, Shakespeare, Dryden, Pope, Gray, and
others.</p>

<p>Yet after all has been said against the spurious character of the
'Rowley' poems, Chatterton's two volumes of collected writings, produced
under the most adverse circumstances, are a record of youthful
precocity unparalleled in literary history. He wrote spirited
satires at ten, and some of his best old verse before sixteen. '&AElig;lla'
is a dramatic poem of sustained power and originality, and its songs
have the true lyric ring; the 'Ode to Liberty,' a fragment from the
tragedy of 'Goddwyn,' is with its bold imagery one of the finest
martial lyrics in the language; the 'Ballad of Charity,' almost the
last poem he wrote, comes in its objectivity and artistic completeness
near to some of Keats's best ballad work. But more wonderful
perhaps than this early blossoming of his genius is its absolute originality.
At a time when Johnson was the literary dictator of London,
and Pope's manner still paramount, Chatterton, unmindful of
their conventionalities and the current French influence, instinctively
turned to earlier models, and sought his inspiration at the true
source of English song. Bishop Percy's 'Reliques of Old English
Poetry,' published in 1765, first made the people acquainted with
their fine old ballads; but by that year Chatterton had already
planned the story of the monk of Bristol and written some of the
poems. Gifted with a rich vein of romance, he heralded the coming
revival of medi&aelig;val literature. But he not only divined the new
movements of poetry&mdash;he was also responsible for one side of its
development. He had a poet's ear for metrical effects, and transmitted
this gift to the romantic poets through Coleridge; for the latter,
deeply interested in the tragedy of the life of the Bristol boy,
studied his work; and traces of this study, resulting in freer rhythm
and new harmonies, are found in Coleridge's own verse. The influence
of the author of 'Christabel' on his brother poets is indisputable;
hence his indebtedness to Chatterton gives to the latter at once
his rightful position as the father of the New Romantic school.
Keats also shows signs of close acquaintance with Chatterton; and he
proves moreover by the dedication of his 'Endymion' that he cherished
the memory of the unfortunate young poet, with whom he had,
as far as the romantic temper on its objective side goes, perhaps the
closest spiritual kinship of any poet of his time.</p>

<p>But quite apart from his youthful precocity and his influence on
later poets, Chatterton holds no mean place in English literature
because of the intrinsic value of his performance. His work, on the
one hand, aside from the 'Rowley' poems, shows him a true poet of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3543]</span>
the eighteenth century, and the best of it entitles him to a fair place
among his contemporaries; but on the other hand he stands almost
alone in his generation in possessing the highest poetic
endowments,&mdash;originality
of thought, a quick eye to see and note, the gift of expression,
sustained power of composition, and a fire and intensity of
imagination. In how far he would have fulfilled his early promise it
is idle to surmise; yet what poet, in the whole range of English,
nay of <i>all</i> literature, at seventeen years and nine months of age, has
produced work of such excellence as this "marvelous boy," who,
unrecognized and driven by famine, took his own life in a London
garret?</p>

<h2><a name="GEOFFREY_CHAUCER" id="GEOFFREY_CHAUCER"></a>GEOFFREY CHAUCER</h2>

<h4>(13&mdash;?-1400)</h4>

<h4>BY THOMAS R. LOUNSBURY</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/cape.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="E" title="E" />
</div><p class="dropcap">nglish literature, in the strict sense of the word, dates its
beginning from the latter half of the fourteenth century.
Not but an English literature had existed long previous to
that period. Furthermore, it reckoned among its possessions works of
value, and a few which in the opinion of some display genius. But
though the name was the same, the thing was essentially different.
A special course of study is required for any comprehension whatever
of the productions of that earliest literature; and for the easy
understanding of those written even but a half-century or so before
the period indicated, a mastery of many peculiar syntactical constructions
is demanded and an acquaintance with a vocabulary differing
in a large number of words from that now in use.</p>

<p>But by the middle of the fourteenth century this state of things
can hardly be said to exist any longer for us. Everything by that
time had become ripe for the creation of a literature of a far higher
type than had yet been produced. Furthermore, conditions prevailed
which, though their results could not then be foreseen, were almost
certain to render the literature thus created comparatively easy of
comprehension to the modern reader. The Teutonic and Romanic
elements that form the groundwork of our present vocabulary had
at last become completely fused. Of the various dialects prevailing,
the one spoken in the vicinity of the capital had gradually lifted
itself up to a pre-eminence it was never afterwards to lose. In this
parent of the present literary speech, writers found for the first time
at their command a widely accepted and comparatively flexible
instrument of expression. As a consequence, the literature then
produced fixed definitely for all time the main lines upon which
both the grammar and the vocabulary of the English speech were to
develop. The result is that it now presents few difficulties for its
full comprehension and appreciation that are not easily surmounted.
The most effective deterrent to its wide study is one formidable
only in appearance. This is the unfamiliar way in which its words
are spelled; for orthography then sought to represent pronunciation,
and had not in consequence crystallized into fixed forms with constant
disregard of any special value to be attached to the signs by
which sounds are denoted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3552]</span></p>
<p>Of the creators of this literature&mdash;Wycliffe, Langland, Chaucer,
and Gower&mdash;Chaucer was altogether the greatest as a man of letters.
This is no mere opinion of the present time: there has never been a
period since he flourished in which it has not been fully conceded.
In his own day, his fame swept beyond the narrow limits of country
and became known to the outside world. At home his reputation
was firmly established, and seems to have been established early.
All the references to him by his contemporaries and immediate successors
bear witness to his universally recognized position as the
greatest of English poets, though we are not left by him in doubt
that he had even then met detractors. Still the general feeling of
the men of his time is expressed by his disciple Occleve, who terms
him</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The firste finder<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of our fair langage."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet not a single incident of his life has come down to us from the
men who admired his personality, who enrolled themselves as his
disciples, and who celebrated his praises. With the exception of a
few slight references to himself in his writings, all the knowledge
we possess of the events of his career is due to the mention made of
him in official documents of various kinds and of different degrees of
importance. In these it is taken for granted that whenever Geoffrey
Chaucer is spoken of, it is the poet who is meant, and not another
person of the same name. The assumption almost approaches absolute
certainty; it does not quite attain to it. In those days it is clear
that there were numerous Chaucers. Still, no one has yet risen to
dispute his being the very person spoken of in these official papers.
From these documents we discover that Chaucer, besides being a
poet, was also a man of affairs. He was a soldier, a negotiator, a
diplomatist. He was early employed in the personal service of the
king. He held various positions in the civil service. It was a consequence
that his name should appear frequently in the records. It is
upon them, and the references to him in documents covering transactions
in which he bore a part, that the story of his life, so far as
it exists for us at all, has been mainly built. It was by them also
that the series of fictitious events which for so long a time did duty
as the biography of the poet had their impossibility as well as their

<p>The exact date of Chaucer's birth we do not know. The most
that can be said is that it must have been somewhere in the early
years of the reign of Edward III. (1327-77). The place of his birth
was in all probability London. His father, John Chaucer, was a
vintner of that city, and there is evidence to indicate that he was to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3553]</span>some extent connected with the court. In a deed dated June 19th,
1380, the poet released his right to his father's former house, which
is described as being in Thames Street. The spot, however unsuitable
for a dwelling-place now, was then in the very heart of urban
life, and in that very neighborhood it is reasonable to suppose that
Chaucer's earliest years were spent.</p>

<p>The first positive information we have, however, about the poet
himself belongs to 1356. In that year we find him attached to the
household of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the third son of Edward III.
He is there in the service of the wife of that prince, but in what
position we do not know. It may have been that of a page. He
naturally was in attendance upon his mistress during her various
journeyings; but most of her time was passed at her residence in
Hatfield, Yorkshire. Chaucer next appears as having joined the
army of Edward III. in his last invasion of France. This expedition
was undertaken in the autumn of 1359, and continued until the peace
of Bretigny, concluded in May, 1360. During this campaign he was
captured somewhere and somehow&mdash;we have no knowledge of anything
beyond the bare fact. It took place, however, before the first
of March, 1360; for on that date the records show that the King personally
contributed sixteen pounds towards his ransom.</p>

<p>From this last-mentioned date Chaucer drops entirely out of our
knowledge till June, 1367, when he is mentioned as one of the valets
of the King's chamber. In the document stating this fact he is
granted a pension&mdash;the first of several he received&mdash;for services
already rendered or to be rendered. It is a natural inference from
the language employed, that during these years of which no record
exists he was in some situation about the person of Edward III.
After this time his name occurs with considerable frequency in the
rolls, often in connection with duties to which he was assigned. His
services were varied; in some instances certainly they were of importance.
From 1370 to 1380 he was sent several times abroad to share
in the conduct of negotiations. These missions led him to Flanders,
to France, and to Italy. The subjects were very diverse. One of
the negotiations in which he was concerned was in reference to the
selection of an English port for a Genoese commercial establishment;
another was concerning the marriage of the young monarch of England
with the daughter of the king of France. It is on his first
journey to Italy of which we have any record&mdash;the mission of
1372-73 to Genoa and Florence&mdash;that everybody hopes and some succeed
in having an undoubting belief that Chaucer visited Petrarch
at Padua, and there heard from him the story of Griselda, which
the Clerk of Oxford in the 'Canterbury Tales' states that he learned
from the Italian poet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3554]</span></p>
<p>But Chaucer's activity was not confined to foreign missions or to
diplomacy; he was as constantly employed in the civil service. In
1374 he was made controller of the great customs&mdash;that is, of wool,
skins, and leather&mdash;of the port of London. In 1382 he received also
the post in the same port of controller of the petty customs&mdash;that
is, of wines, candles, and other articles. The regulations of the office
required him to write the records with his own hand; and it is this
to which Chaucer is supposed to refer in the statement he makes
about his official duties in the 'House of Fame.' In that poem the
messenger of Jupiter tells him that though he has done so much in
the service of the God of Love, yet he has never received for it any
compensation. He then goes on to add the following lines, which
give a graphic picture of the poet and of his studious life:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>In 1386 Chaucer was elected to Parliament as knight of the shire
for the county of Kent. In that same year he lost or gave up both
his positions in the customs. The cause we do not know. It may
have been due to mismanagement on his own part: it is far more
likely that he fell a victim to one of the fierce factional disputes that
were going on during the minority of Richard II. At any rate, from
this time he again disappears for two years from our knowledge. But
in 1389 he is mentioned as having been appointed clerk of the King's
works at Westminster and various other places; in 1390 clerk of the
works for St. George's chapel at Windsor. Both of these places he
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3555]</span>held until the middle of 1391. In that last year he was made one of
the commissioners to repair the roadway along the Thames, and at
about the same time was appointed forester of North Petherton Park
in Somerset, a post which he held till his death. After 1386 he
seems at times to have been in pecuniary difficulties. To what cause
they were owing, or how severe they were, it is the emptiest of
speculations to form any conjectures in the obscurity that envelops
this portion of his life. Whatever may have been his situation, on
the accession of Henry IV. in September, 1399, his fortunes revived.
The father of that monarch was John of Gaunt, the fourth son of
Edward III. That nobleman had pretty certainly been from the outset
the patron of Chaucer; it is possible&mdash;as the evidence fails on
one side, it cannot be regarded as proved&mdash;that by his marriage
with Katharine Swynford he became the poet's brother-in-law. Whatever
may have been the relationship, if any at all, it is a fact that
one of the very first things the new king did was to confer upon
Chaucer an additional pension. But the poet did not live long to
enjoy the favor of the monarch. On the 24th of December, 1399, he
leased for fifty-three years or during the term of his life a tenement
in the garden of St. Mary's Chapel, Westminster. But after the 5th
of June, 1400, his name appears no longer on any rolls. There is
accordingly no reason to question the accuracy of the inscription on
his tombstone which represents him as having died October 25th,
1400. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was the first, and
still remains perhaps the greatest, of the English poets whose bones
have there found their last resting-place.</p>

<p>This comprises all the facts of importance we know of Chaucer's
life. Before leaving this branch of the subject, however, it may be
well to say that many fuller details about his career can be found in
all older accounts of the poet, and in spite of the repeated exposure
of their falsity still crop up occasionally in modern books of reference.
Some are objectionable only upon the ground of being untrue.
Of these are such statements as that he was born in 1328; that he
was a student of Oxford, to which Cambridge is sometimes added;
that he was created poet-laureate; and that he was knighted. But
others are objectionable not only on the ground of being false, but
of being slanderous besides. Of these the most offensive is the
widely circulated and circumstantial story that he was concerned
in the conflict that went on in 1382 between the city of London and
the court in regard to the election of John of Northampton to the
mayoralty; that in consequence of his participation in this contest he
was compelled to seek refuge in the island of Zealand; that there he
remained for some time, but on his return to England was arrested
and thrown into the Tower; and that after having been imprisoned
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3556]</span>for two or three years he was released at last on the condition of
betraying his associates, which he accordingly did. All these details
are fictitious. They were made up from inferences drawn from
obscure passages in a prose work entitled 'The Testament of Love.'
This was once attributed to the poet, but is now known not to have
been written by him. Even had it been his, the statements derived
from it and applied to the life of the poet would have been entirely
unwarranted, as they come into constant conflict with the official
records. Not being his, this piece of spurious biography has the
additional discredit of constituting an unnecessary libel upon his
character.</p>

<p>From Chaucer the man, and the man of affairs, we proceed now
to the consideration of Chaucer the writer. He has left behind a
body of verse consisting of more than thirty-two thousand lines, and
a smaller but still far from inconsiderable quantity of prose. The
latter consists mainly if not wholly of translations&mdash;one a version
of that favorite work of the Middle Ages, the treatise of Bo&euml;tius on
the 'Consolation of Philosophy'; another the tale of Melibeus in the
'Canterbury Tales,' which is taken directly from the French; thirdly,
the Parson's Tale, derived probably from the same quarter, though
its original has not as yet been discovered with certainty; and
fourthly, an unfinished treatise on the Astrolabe, undertaken for the
instruction of his son Lewis. The prose of any literature always lags
behind, and sometimes centuries behind, its poetry. It is therefore
not surprising to find Chaucer displaying in the former but little of
the peculiar excellence which distinguishes his verse. In the latter
but little room is found for hostile criticism. In the more than thirty
thousand lines of which it is composed there occur of course inferior
passages, and some positively weak; but taking it all in all, there is
comparatively little in it, considered as a whole, which the lover of
literature as literature finds it advisable or necessary to skip. In this
respect the poet holds a peculiar position, which makes the task of
representation difficult. As Southey remarked, Chaucer with the
exception of Shakespeare is the most various of all English authors.
He appeals to the most diversified tastes. He wrote love poems,
religious poems, allegorical poems, occasional poems, tales of common
life, tales of chivalry. His range is so wide that any limited
selection from his works can at best give but an inadequate idea of
the variety and extent of his powers.</p>

<p>The canon of Chaucer's writings has now been settled with a reasonable
degree of certainty. For a long time the fashion existed of
imputing to him the composition of any English poem of the century
following his death which was floating about without having attached
to it the name of any author. The consequence is that the older
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3557]</span>editions contain a mass of matter which it would have been distinctly
discreditable for any one to have produced, let alone a great poet.
This has now been gradually dropped, much to the advantage of
Chaucer's reputation; though modern scholarship also refuses to admit
the production by him of two or three pieces, such as 'The Court
of Love,' 'The Flower and the Leaf,' 'The Cuckoo and the Nightingale,'
none of which was unworthy of his powers. It is possible
indeed that the poet himself may have had some dread of being
saddled with the responsibility of having produced pieces which he
did not care to father. It is certainly suggestive that he himself took
the pains on one occasion to furnish what it seems must have been
at the time a fairly complete list of his writings. In the prologue to
the 'Legend of Good Women' he gave an idea of the work which up
to that period he had accomplished. The God of Love, in the interview
which is there described as having taken place, inveighs against
the poet for having driven men away from the service due to his
deity, by the character of what he had written. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>This prologue is generally conceded to have been written between
1382 and 1385. Though it does not profess to furnish a complete list
of Chaucer's writings, it can fairly be assumed that it included all
which he then regarded as of importance either on account of their
merit or their length. If so, the titles given above would embrace
the productions of what may be called the first half of his literary
career. In fact, his disciple Lydgate leads us to believe that 'Troilus
and Cressida' was a comparatively early production, though it
may have undergone and probably did undergo revision before
assuming its present form. The 'Legend of Good Women'&mdash;in distinction
from its prologue&mdash;would naturally occupy the time of the
poet during the opening period of what is here termed the second
half of his literary career. The prologue is the only portion of it,
however, that is of distinctly high merit. The work was never completed,
and Chaucer pretty certainly came soon to the conclusion
that it was not worth completing. It was in the taste of the times;
but it did not take him long to perceive that an extended work
dealing exclusively with the sorrows of particular individuals was as
untrue to art as it was to life. It fell under the ban of that criticism
which in the 'Canterbury Tales' he puts into the mouth of the
Knight, who interrupts the doleful recital of the tragical tales told by
the Monk with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Ho,' quoth the knight, 'good sir, no more of this:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And of such thing were goodly for to tell.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Accordingly, from the composition of pieces of the one-sided and
unsatisfactory character of those contained in the 'Legend of Good
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3559]</span>Women,' Chaucer turned to the preparation of his great work, the
'Canterbury Tales.' This gave him the fullest opportunity to display
all his powers, and must have constituted the main literary occupation
of his later life.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that two of the works mentioned in the prologue
to the 'Legend of Good Women' are translations, and are so avowed.
One is of the 'Roman de la Rose,' and the other of the philosophical
treatise of Bo&euml;tius. In regard to the version of the former
which has come down, it is sufficient to say that there was not long
ago a disposition to deny the genuineness of all of it. This now
contents itself with denying the genuineness of part of it. The
question cannot be considered here: it is enough to say that in the
opinion of the present writer, while the subject is attended with
certain difficulties, the evidence is strongly in favor of Chaucer's
composition of the whole. But setting aside any discussion of this
point, there can scarcely be any doubt that Chaucer began his career
as a translator. At the period he flourished he could hardly have
done otherwise. It was an almost inevitable method of procedure on
the part of a man who found neither writers nor writings in his own
tongue worthy of imitation, and who could not fail to be struck not
merely by the excellence of the Latin classic poets but also by the
superior culture of the Continent. In the course of his literary
development he would naturally pass from direct translation to adaptation.
To the latter practice he assuredly resorted often. He took
the work of the foreign author as a basis, discarded what he did not
need or care for, and added as little or as much as suited his own
convenience. In this way the 5704 lines of the 'Filostrato' of Boccaccio
became 8246 in the 'Troilus and Cressida' of Chaucer; but
even of the 5704 of the Italian poet, 2974 were not used by the
English poet at all, and the 2730 that were used underwent considerable
compression. In a similar way he composed the 'Knight's
Tale,' probably the most perfect narrative poem in our tongue. It
was based upon the 'Theseide' of Boccaccio. But the latter has
9896 lines, while the former comprises but 2250; and of these 2250
fully two-thirds are entirely independent of the Italian poem.</p>

<p>With such free treatment of his material, Chaucer's next step
would be to direct composition, independent of any sources, save in
that general way in which every author is under obligation to what
has been previously produced. This finds its crowning achievement
in the 'Canterbury Tales'; though several earlier pieces&mdash;such as
the 'House of Fame,' the 'Parliament of Fowls,' and the prologue to
the 'Legend of Good Women,'&mdash;attest that long before he had
shown his ability to produce work essentially original. But though in
his literary development Chaucer worked himself out of this exact
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3560]</span>reproduction of his models, through a partial working over of them
till he finally attained complete independence, the habits of a
translator clung to him to the very end. Even after he had fully
justified his claim to being a great original poet, passages occur
in his writings which are nothing but the reproduction of passages
found in some foreign poem in Latin, or French, or Italian, the three
languages with which he was conversant. His translation of them
was due to the fact that they had struck his fancy; his insertion of
them into his own work was to please others with what had previously
pleased himself. Numerous passages of this kind have been
pointed out; and doubtless there are others which remain to be
pointed out.</p>

<p>There is another important thing to be marked in the history of
Chaucer's artistic development. Not only was poetic material lacking
in the tongue at the time of his appearance, but also poetic form.
The measures in use, while not inadequate for literary expression,
were incapable of embodying it in its highest flights. Consequently
what Chaucer did not find, he had either to borrow or to invent.
He did both. In the lines which have been quoted he speaks of the
"ballades, roundels, and virelayes" which he had composed. These
were all favorite poetical forms in that Continental country with
whose literature Chaucer was mainly conversant. There can be little
question that he tried all manner of verse which the ingenuity of
the poets of Northern France had devised. As many of his shorter
pieces have very certainly disappeared, his success in these various
attempts cannot be asserted with positiveness. Still, what have survived
show that he was a great literary artist as well as a great
poet. His feats of rhyming, in particular in a tongue so little fitted
for it as is ours, can be seen in his unfinished poem of 'Queen
Anelida and False Arcite,' in the 'Complaint to Venus,' and in the
envoy which follows the Clerk's Tale. In this last piece, though
there are thirty-six lines, the rhymes are only three; and two of
these belong to fifteen lines respectively.</p>

<p>But far more important than such attempts, which prove interest
in versification rather than great poetic achievement, are the two
measures which he introduced into our tongue. The first was the
seven-line stanza. The rhyming lines in it are respectively the first
and third; the second, fourth, and fifth; and the sixth and seventh.
At a later period this was frequently called "rhyme royal," because
the 'Kingis Quair' was written in it. For fully two centuries it was
one of the most popular measures in English poetry. Since the sixteenth
century, however, it has been but little employed. Far different
has been the fate of the line of ten syllables, or rather of five
accents. On account of its frequent use in the 'Canterbury Tales' it
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3561]</span>was called for a long period "riding rhyme"; but it now bears the
title of "heroic verse." As employed by Chaucer it varies in slight
particulars from the way it is now generally used. With him the
couplet character was never made prominent. The sense was not apt
to end at the second line, but constantly tended to run over into the
line following. There was also frequently with him an unaccented
eleventh syllable; and this, though not unknown to modern verse, is
not common. Still, the difference between the early and the later
form are mere differences of detail, and of comparatively unimportant
detail. The introduction of this measure into English may be
considered Chaucer's greatest achievement in the matter of versification.
The heroic verse may have existed in the tongue before he
himself used it. If so, it lurked unseen and uninfluential. He was
the first to employ it on a grand scale, if not to employ it at all,
and to develop its capabilities. Much the largest proportion of his
greatest work is written in that measure. Yet in spite of his example,
it found for two centuries comparatively few imitators. It was
not till the end of the sixteenth century that the measure started on
a new course of life, and entered upon the great part it has since
played in English versification.</p>

<p>The most important of what are sometimes called the minor
works of Chaucer are the 'Parliament of Fowls,' the 'House of
Fame,' 'Troilus and Cressida,' and the 'Legend of Good Women.'
These are all favorable examples of his genius. But however good
they may be in particular portions and in particular respects, in general
excellence they yield place unquestionably to the 'Canterbury
Tales.' It seems to have been very clearly the intention of the poet
to embody in this crowning achievement of his literary life everything
in the shape of a story he had already composed or was purposing
to compose. Two of the pieces, the love of Palamon and
Arcite and the Life of St. Cecilia, as we know from the words of
his already quoted, had appeared long before. The plan of the work
itself was most happily conceived; and in spite of most painstaking
efforts to find an original for it or suggestion of it somewhere else,
there seems no sufficient reason for doubting that the poet himself
was equal to the task of having devised it. No one certainly can
question the felicity with which the framework for embodying the
tales was constructed. All ranks and classes of society are brought
together in the company of pilgrims who assemble at the Tabard
Inn at Southwark to ride to the shrine of the saint at Canterbury.
The military class is represented by the Knight, belonging to the
highest order of the nobility, his son the Squire, and his retainer the
Yeoman; the church by the Abbot, the Friar, the Parson, the Prioress
with her attendant Nun, and the three accompanying Priests,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3562]</span>and less distinctly by the Scholar, the Clerk of Oxford, and by the
Pardoner and the Summoner. For the other professions are the
Doctor of Physic and the Serjeant of Law; for the middle-class landholders
the Franklin; and for the various crafts and occupations the
Haberdasher, the Carpenter, the Weaver, the Dyer, the Upholsterer,
the Cook, the Ploughman, the Sailor, the Reeve, the Manciple, and
(joining the party in the course of the pilgrimage) the assistant of
the alchemist, who is called the Canon's Yeoman. Into the mouths
of these various personages were to be put tales befitting their character
and condition. Consequently there was ample space for stories
of chivalry, of religion, of love, of magic, and in truth of every
aspect of social life in all its highest and lowest manifestations.
Between the tales themselves were connecting links, in which the
poet had the opportunity to give an account of the incidents that
took place on the pilgrimage, the critical opinions expressed by the
hearers of what had been told, and the disputes and quarrels that
went on between the various members of the party. So far as this
portion of his plan was finished, these connecting links furnish some
of the most striking passages in the work. In one of them&mdash;the
prologue to the Wife of Bath's Tale&mdash;the genius of the poet reaches
along certain lines its highest development; while the general prologue
describing the various personages of the party, though not
containing the highest poetry of the work as poetry, is the most
acute, discriminating, and brilliant picture of men and manners that
can be found in our literature.</p>

<p>Such was the plan of the work. It was laid out on an extensive
scale, perhaps on too extensive a scale ever to have been completed.
Certain it is that it was very far from ever reaching even remotely
that result. According to the scheme set forth in the prologue, the
work when finished should have included over one hundred and
twenty tales. It actually comprises but twenty-four. Even of these,
two are incomplete: the Cook's Tale, which is little more than begun,
and the romantic Eastern tale of the Squire, which, in Milton's words,
is "left half told." To those that are finished, the connecting links
have not been supplied in many cases. Accordingly the work exists
not as a perfect whole, but in eight or nine fragmentary parts, each
complete in itself, but lacking a close connection with the others,
though all are bound together by the unity of a common central
interest. The value of what has been done makes doubly keen the
regret that so much has been left undone. Politics, religion, literature,
manners, are all touched upon in this wide-embracing view,
which still never misses what is really essential; and added to this
is a skill of portrayal by which the actors, whether narrating the
tales themselves, or themselves forming the heroes of the narration,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3563]</span>
fairly live and breathe before our eyes. Had the work been completed
on the scale upon which it was begun, we should have had a
picture of life and opinion in the fourteenth century more vivid and
exact than has been drawn of any century before or since.</p>

<p>The selections given are partly of extracts and partly of complete
pieces. To the former class belong the lines taken from the opening
of the 'Canterbury Tales,' with the description of a few of the characters;
the description of the temples of Mars, of Venus, and of Diana
in the Knight's Tale; and the account of the disappearance of the
fairies at the opening of the Wife of Bath's Tale. The complete
pieces are the tales of the Pardoner, and of the Nun's Priest. From
the first, however, has been dropped the discourse on drunkenness,
profanity, and gambling, which, though in keeping with the character
of the narrator, has no connection with the development of the
story. The second, the tale of the Nun's Priest, was modernized by
Dryden under the title of the 'Cock and the Fox.' All of these are
in heroic verse. The final selection is the ballade now usually entitled
'Truth.' In it the peculiar ballade construction can be studied&mdash;that
is, the formation in three stanzas, either with or without an
envoy; the same rhymes running through the three stanzas; and the
final line of each stanza precisely the same. One of Chaucer's religious
poems&mdash;the so-called 'A B C'&mdash;can be found under Deguileville,
from whose 'P&egrave;lerinage la de Vie Humaine' it is translated.</p>

<p>Chaucer's style, like that of all great early writers, is marked by
perfect simplicity, and his language is therefore comparatively easy
to understand. In the extracts here given the spelling has been
modernized, save occasionally at the end of the line, when the
rhyme has required the retention of an earlier form. The words
themselves and grammatical forms have of course undergone no
change. There are two marks used to indicate the pronunciation:
first, the acute accent to indicate that a heavier stress than ordinary
is to be placed on the syllable over which it stands; and secondly,
the grave accent to indicate that the letter or syllable over which it
appears, though silent in modern pronunciation, was then sounded.
Thus <i>land&egrave;s</i>, <i>grov&egrave;s</i>, <i>friend&egrave;s</i>, <i>knav&egrave;s</i>, would have the final
syllable
sounded; and in a similar way <i>tim&egrave;</i>, <i>Rom&egrave;</i>, and others ending in <i>e</i>, when
the next word begins with a vowel or <i>h</i> mute. The acute accent can
be exemplified in words like <i>cour&aacute;ge</i>, <i>reas&oacute;n</i>, <i>hono&uacute;r</i>, <i>translat&eacute;d</i>,
where
the accent would show that the final syllable would either receive the
main stress or a heavier stress than is now given it. Again, a word
like <i>cre-a-ture</i> consists, in the pronunciation here given, of three syllables
and not of two, and is accordingly represented by a grave accent
over the <i>a</i> to signify that this vowel forms a separate syllable, and
by the acute accent over the <i>ture</i> to indicate that this final syllable
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3564]</span>should receive more weight of pronunciation than usual. It accordingly
appears as <i>cre&agrave;t&uacute;re</i>. In a similar way <i>con-dit-i-on</i> would be a
word of four syllables, and its pronunciation would be indicated by
this method <i>condit&igrave;&oacute;n</i>. It is never to be forgotten that Chaucer had
no superior in the English tongue as a master of melody; and if a
verse of his sounds inharmonious, it is either because the line is corrupt
or because the reader has not succeeded in pronouncing it correctly.</p>

<p>The explanation of obsolete words or meanings is given in the
foot-notes. In addition to these the following variations from modern
English that occur constantly, and are therefore not defined,
should be noted. <i>Hir</i> and <i>hem</i> stand for 'their' and 'them.' The
affix <i>y</i>- is frequently prefixed to the past participle, which itself
sometimes omits the final <i>en</i> or <i>-n</i>, as 'ydrawe,' 'yshake.' The imperative
plural ends in <i>-th,</i> as 'dreadeth.' The general negative <i>ne</i>
is sometimes to be defined by 'not,' sometimes by 'nor'; and connected
with forms of the verb 'be' gives us <i>nis</i>, 'is not'; <i>nas</i>, 'was
not.' <i>As</i> is often an expletive, and cannot be rendered at all; <i>that</i>
before 'one' and 'other' is usually the definite article; <i>there</i> is frequently
to be rendered by 'where'; <i>mo</i> always means 'more'; <i>thilke</i>
means 'that' or 'that same'; <i>del</i> is 'deal' in the sense of 'bit,'
'whit'; and the comparatives of 'long' and 'strong' are <i>lenger</i> and
<i>strenger</i>. Finally it should be borne in mind that the double negative
invariably strengthens the negation.</p>

<h2><a name="ANDRE_CHENIER" id="ANDRE_CHENIER"></a>ANDR&Eacute; CH&Eacute;NIER</h2>

<h4>(1762-1794)</h4>

<h4>BY KATHARINE HILLARD</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">here are some reputations which seem to depend upon their
environment. Certain names are surrounded by a halo of
romance, through which all outlines are enlarged and
heightened in effect until it becomes difficult to discern their true
proportions through the golden mist. When we think of Andr&eacute;
Ch&eacute;nier we see a youthful figure among a crowd of fellow-prisoners,
the light of genius in his eyes, the dark shadow of impending death
already enveloping him and climbing slowly upwards, as the mist of
the Highland second-sight rises higher as
death draws near. The pathetic character
of his fate touches the heart, and disposes
us to judge the poems he wrote with that
bias of personal interest which is so apt to
warp the verdict of the critical mind. Had
Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier died comfortably in his bed
at a good old age, would Sainte-Beuve
have been so apt to call him "our greatest
classic poet since Racine and Boileau"?
unless indeed he had vainly racked his
memory to think of any other.</p>

</div>

<p>Andr&eacute;-Marie de Ch&eacute;nier&mdash;as he was
called until 1790 swept away all ornamental
particles&mdash;was born amid picturesque surroundings
at Constantinople, October 30th, 1762, where his father
then held the office of Consul-General. He had married a young
Greek girl, a Mademoiselle Santi-l'Homaka, whose family came
originally from the island of Cyprus. A Languedocian father, a
Cyprian mother, an Oriental birthplace,&mdash;it was no wonder that the
passionate fire of his blood flamed somewhat too hotly through his
verse. Andr&eacute; was the third of four sons, and four daughters were
also born to M. de Ch&eacute;nier. In 1765, when he was but three years
old, his father returned to France; but two years afterwards left his
native country again to fill a diplomatic position in Morocco, while
his wife remained in Paris with their children.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; seems to have always looked back with pleasure to his
Eastern birthplace, and long cherished the hope of revisiting it, but<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3602]</span>
he never got farther on the way than Italy. Madame de Ch&eacute;nier,
who was a refined and cultivated woman with much taste for art
and literature, gave him his first lessons; but he was soon sent
with his brothers to the College of Navarre. There he made many
friendships that lasted to the end of his short life, and his school-fellows,
some of whom belonged to noble and wealthy families, often
took him to spend his holidays at their country-houses.</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen he carried off a first prize in rhetoric; and
from that time began his apprenticeship to the trade of the Muses,
as Ronsard would say, by writing translations of Greek and Latin
verse. He does not seem to have been particularly precocious as a
poet, and his imitations of Sappho were even then considered rather
feeble. His mother's salon was thronged with artists, poets, writers,
and men of the world, among whom Andr&eacute; might have found many
indulgent listeners, were it not that his reserve and fastidious taste
made him rather chary of exhibiting his youthful efforts. His mind
was already full of ambitious projects for future epics, and his
leisure was spent very much as his classic models had spent theirs,
in light and facile pleasures and loves.</p>

<p>M. de Ch&eacute;nier, who watched over his family from afar, was ambitious
for the future of his sons; Constantine, the eldest, was already
in the diplomatic service; the other three were destined for the
army. Andr&eacute; joined his regiment when he was twenty, and went to
Strasbourg to learn his new duties; but the life of a soldier was not
congenial to him, and although he made one or two dear friends in
the garrison, the six months that he spent there seemed interminable,
and he returned to Paris to resume his life of elegant dissipation
among his rich and titled acquaintances. But his health began to
give way, and the hope of relief from a change of climate induced
him to join his old friends, the brothers Louis and Charles Trudaine,
in a journey they projected through Switzerland and Italy to Constantinople.
The three friends started together in the summer of
1784, passed through Switzerland, and spent the autumn and winter
in Italy; but although they remained away a year, they never got
any further.</p>

<p>This journey and its experiences did much to educate and enrich
the mind of Andr&eacute;, and he continued to devote much time to study
and poetic composition to the elaboration of vast schemes for dramas
and epics, and to the imitation of the Greek and Latin poets he
loved and copied so well. He wished to enlarge the province of the
idyl, and to give to it more variety than even Theocritus had succeeded
in doing; to make it more dramatic, less rustic, and in short
if we may judge from the assertions of his countrymen, a more perfect
picture of that elegant and aristocratic world in which he moved.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3603]</span>
The idyls of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier are to poetry very much what the pictures
of Watteau and Boucher are to painting. The variety he
wished so much to impart to them is after all confined to the grouping
of the figures, and their greatest beauty is the classic elegance
of their style; as one of his French biographers says, "The style of
these poems makes up for what the sentiment lacks of ideality, and
lends a sort of purity to details which from any other pen would
have run great risk of coarseness." Sainte-Beuve speaks of "his
boxwood flute, his ivory lute"; but all this beauty of diction, this
smoothness and grace of verse, can hardly blind the unprejudiced
critic to the fact that "a sort of purity" will hardly make up for his
too frequent choice of subjects that appeal only to the grossest tastes.
His highest ideals, like those of most poets, were never reached.
He had lofty visions of writing a poem called 'Hermes,' which
should be an exposition of natural and social laws, principles, and
progress; a system of philosophy in heroic couplets, beginning with
the birth of humanity and its first questioning of natural phenomena,
its first efforts to solve the problems of the universe, and coming
down to the latest discoveries of physical and political science. He
never succeeded in completing the preliminary studies necessary to
the carrying out of this vast conception, and the 'Hermes' remains
a mass of incoherent fragments.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; de Ch&eacute;nier had not the robust common-sense that underlay
all the poetic eccentricities of the poet whom in many ways he so
much resembled,&mdash;Alfred de Musset. The latter knew and recognized
his limitations. "My glass is not large, but I drink from my
own glass," he said, and what he did attempt was well within his
possibilities and was exquisitely done. Not so with Ch&eacute;nier. With
a genius like that of De Musset, pre-eminently lyrical, but with infinitely
less variety and richness, he laboriously accumulated vast piles
of materials for dramas and for epics that if ever completed must
have but added another page to the list of literary soporifics. He
made a colossal sketch of another poem, to be called 'America,'&mdash;a
sort of geographical and historical encyclopedia, M. Joubert calls it,
whose enormous mass of detail could scarcely be floated by any one
current of interest, but whose principal motive seemed meant to be
the conquest of Peru.</p>

<p>In the midst of these enterprises he suddenly conceived what one
of his biographers calls "the amiable intention" of writing a poem on
the story of 'Susannah and the Elders,' but only completed a prose
sketch with two or three short passages in verse. He also began one
or two tragedies which were to be after &AElig;schylus, a comedy called
'The Charlatans,' poems on the literary life, and many other subjects;
and at the same time he was keeping up his relations with<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3604]</span>
many of his distinguished contemporaries;&mdash;the Polish poet Niemcewicz;
Mrs. Cosway, the charming young wife of the well-known
English painter, and an artist herself; the Italian poet Alfieri; and
the Countess of Albany.</p>

<p>In 1787 his father, who had returned to Paris, was anxious that
Andr&eacute; should begin his diplomatic career; and he was appointed
attach&eacute; to M. de la Luzerne, just sent as ambassador to England.
The poet went to London in December,&mdash;a most unpropitious season,&mdash;and
naturally nothing pleased him there; he found the climate
detestable, the manners of the English rude and cold, their literature
of a barbaric richness, and in fact he approved of nothing in England
but its Constitution, which he thought not only good but worthy of
imitation.</p>

<p>He had been in London about sixteen months when the first
rumors of the French Revolution reached him and turned all his
thoughts towards the great political questions of the moment. The
project of a rule of liberty and justice for France appealed to the
noblest side of his nature; and while passionately opposed to all
excess and violence, he was eager to assist any movement that
promised to help the people.</p>

<p>With his friends the brothers Trudaine, he joined the Society of
'89, when it was a centre for varying shades of opinion, reconciled
by a common love of liberty and hatred of anarchy. He returned
to Paris definitely in the summer of 1790, and wrote independent
and impassioned articles in the Journal of the Society of 1789, warning
the people against their real enemies, the fomenters of anarchy,
while he expressed much the same ideas in one of the most celebrated
of his poems, the ode to David's picture called 'Le Jeu de
Paume,' representing the deputies taking their famous oath in the
Hall of the Jeu de Paume at Versailles. Lacretelle, in his reminiscences
published half a century later, spoke of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier as a fellow-member
of the club called Friends of the Constitution, as a man
of great talent and great force of character:&mdash;"The most decided
and the most eloquently expressed opinions always came from him.
His strongly marked features, his athletic though not lofty stature,
his dark complexion, his glowing eyes, enforced and illuminated his
words. Demosthenes as well as Pindar had been the object of his
study."</p>

<p>But moderate opinions and a horror of the excesses of the Revolution
were very unsafe things to hold. Although Andr&eacute; took refuge
in 1793 in a quiet little house at Versailles, he could not stay there
altogether, but made frequent visits to Paris; and an unfortunate
chance caused his arrest at the house of M. Pastoret at Passy, where
he was accused of having gone to warn his friend of his own danger.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3605]</span>
Ch&eacute;nier was first taken to the prison of the Luxembourg, which was
too full to receive him, and then to St. Lazare, where he was registered
on the 8th of March, 1794.</p>

<p>Apart from the suspicion which caused his arrest, he could hardly
have escaped much longer; his fellow editor of the Journal de Paris
had already been in St. Lazare for several months, and his friends
the Trudaines joined him there before long. M. de Ch&eacute;nier exerted
all his influence to procure his son's liberation, but was put off with
promises and polite evasions; and not long after, his second son,
Sauveur, was imprisoned in the Conciergerie.</p>

<p>By this time there were nearly eight thousand persons in the
prisons of Paris; about eight hundred in St. Lazare, where Ch&eacute;nier
found many of his friends, and among the ladies there the beautiful
and charming young Duchess of Fleury. It was she who inspired the
poet with the idea of his poem called 'The Young Captive,' perhaps
the most beautiful, as it is the most touching, of all his poems.</p>

<p>Shortly before Ch&eacute;nier was arrested he had formed a close
friendship with Madame Pourrat of Luciennes and her two daughters,
the Countess Hocquart and Madame Laurent Lecoulteux. To the
latter, under the name of Fanny, he addressed many charming
verses; one ode in particular, that seems to have been intended to
accompany the gift of a necklace, is almost worthy of Ronsard,
although like many of Ch&eacute;nier's poems it was never finished.</p>

<p>His last poems were written in a very fine hand on some narrow
strips of paper that had escaped the vigilance of his jailers, and were
smuggled out of prison with the linen that went to the wash.</p>

<p>On the flimsy pretext of a conspiracy among the prisoners, Andr&eacute;
Ch&eacute;nier, then only thirty-one, was condemned with twenty-five others
as "an enemy of the people, and for having shared in all the crimes
perpetrated by the tyrant, his wife, and his family; of writing against
liberty and in favor of tyranny; of corresponding with enemies of
the republic abroad and at home; and finally of conspiring, in the
prison of St. Lazare, to murder the members of the committees of
general safety, etc., and to re-establish royalty in France."</p>

<p>The twenty-five victims went through the mockery of their trial
in the morning of the 25th of July, 1794, and at six the same evening
were executed at the Barri&egrave;re de Vincennes. Three days afterward,
Robespierre and many of his accomplices perished upon the
scaffold, and the Reign of Terror was at an end.</p>

<p>Very little of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier's poetry was left in a state fit for
publication; he began so many vast enterprises of which he left but
the merest fragments, and he wrote so much that his literary executors
feared would shock the public taste. His brother published
'The Young Captive' and one or two other poems some seven years<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3606]</span>
after his death, which were quoted by Ch&acirc;teaubriand in 1802 and
warmly admired by him. The first complete edition of his poems
did not appear till 1819, a year before Lamartine's 'Meditations'
came out, and three years before Victor Hugo's first collection was
printed. He was not considered a great poet by his first readers, and
he would be almost a forgotten one now, were it not for the romance
of his short life and his early death. He was the precursor of Byron
and De Musset, having the ardent love of liberty of the former and
the sensuous grace of the latter; but he lacked the strength for a
sustained flight, and he did not know the measure of his powers. He
had saturated himself too completely with the honey of Greek verse,
and was prisoned in its cloying sweetness. When he would soar into
the empyrean, his wings were clogged, and he soon fell back again
among the flowers. But he will always be a notable figure in French
literature, although we may not consider him, with his French admirers,
as one of the masters among the poets of our own time.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">n 1863 the Revue des Deux Mondes offered its readers a novel
by a young author very slightly known to Parisian <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i>.
But everybody read him with interest, whether cordially
approving or not. The story was not evolutionary, had no
definite moral purpose. Perhaps the public were glad to temporarily
lay aside their instruments for scientific dissection of literary art; for
'Le Comte Kostia,' a lively tale of romantic adventure, was the
most popular story that had been published by the Revue des Deux
Mondes. Naturally the gratified editors
accepted the author as a regular contributor,
which he has been ever since. He
had been introduced to them by George
Sand, who, pleased with an earlier work of
his, wrote him appreciatively and did him
this kind turn. This earlier work, 'Un
Cheval de Phidias' (A Horse by Phidias),
cordially praised by Sainte-Beuve, was a
capable dissertation upon arch&aelig;ology and
art, strung on a thread of narrative.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Victor Cherbuliez</span></span>
</div>

<p>The young author, Victor Cherbuliez,&mdash;Genevese,
of French descent,&mdash;was about
thirty-four when 'Le Comte Kostia' appeared.
A critic in discussing him speaks
almost enviously of the liberalizing influences experienced in cosmopolitan
little Switzerland. Cherbuliez's advantages have been great.
His father was a professor in the university, and of his parents it
has been pleasantly said that from his father he learned all he ought
to know, from his mother all he ought to be. He was graduated
from the University of Geneva, and later studied history and philosophy
at Paris, Bonn, and Berlin. For a time he taught at Geneva;
then he married, and with his wife traveled extensively in the East,
where he collected abundant material for his trained powers of observation
and his love of social and artistic questions. He has been a
member of the Academy since 1881, and now lives in Paris,&mdash;a perennial
novel-writer, distinguished also for the clever sketches on
modern French politics which appear regularly in the Revue des
Deux Mondes signed "George Valbert."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3610]</span></p>
<p>But his best and most abundant work has been in fiction, where
his talent lies in the union of romantic imagination with a practical
view of life. There is sometimes falsetto in the imagination, but it
gratifies a liking for falsetto in many readers. Translated, his novels
have been read almost as much in English as in French; and among
the best liked are 'L'Id&eacute;e de Jean T&eacute;t&eacute;rol' (Jean T&eacute;t&eacute;rol's Idea); 'La
Revanche de Joseph Noircel' (Joseph Noircel's Revenge); 'Le Docteur
Rameau.'</p>

<p>If they refuse Cherbuliez a place among great writers, at least
the critics always respect his cleverness, and recognize the range of
his information regarding the art, literature, politics, and history of
different lands. The prime quality of his work is <i>interest</i>. His remarkable
inventiveness shows in one unusual situation after another,
without repetition and with always fresh stimulus. His kinship with
George Sand's romantic spirit was felt at once, and his style has
always remained essentially unchanged. But that his earlier emotional
spontaneity has grown with maturity to a more conventional
spirit, may be seen by comparing the two ends of his work. In
'Le Comte Kostia' we have the persecution of a beautiful young
daughter by a Russian nobleman. He forces her to hide her sex and
personate the son he has lost, and subjects her to many terrors until
she is rescued by his chivalrous young secretary, who in time discovers
her secret and marries her,&mdash;but first, numberless adventures
and scenes of passion. In 'Le Roi Ep&egrave;pi' (King Ep&egrave;pi: 1895) there
is no profound emotion. It is the cleverly cynical account of the rescue
by a worldly old uncle of a romantic and short-sighted nephew.
The young man, infatuated by an adventuress, insists upon marrying
her. The uncle ingeniously, without compromising himself, leads the
lady to believe that he himself is in love with her. Naturally she
prefers proprietor to heir, and throws over the latter only to find
herself deceived.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to indicate Cherbuliez's place in French literature
is by comparison with the English Trollope. Both create
interest. Both have a swift firm style, with sometimes almost too
facile a rush. But while Trollope draws ordinary men and women
who talk in ordinary fashion, Cherbuliez invents brilliant-minded
people who shower us with epigram. They shoulder too much of
their creator's erudition, and are too clever to be quite natural.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SILENT_DUEL" id="THE_SILENT_DUEL"></a>THE SILENT DUEL</h3>

<h4>From 'Samuel Brohl and Company'</h4>

<p>Madame de Lorcy ushered Samuel into the salon, where he
had scarcely set foot when he descried an old woman
lounging on a <i>causeuse</i>, fanning herself as she chatted
with Abb&eacute; Miollens. He remained motionless, his eyes fixed,
scarcely breathing, cold as marble; it seemed to him that the
four walls of the salon swayed from right to left and left to
right, and that the floor was sliding from under his feet like the
deck of a pitching vessel.</p>

<p>The previous day, Antoinette once departed, Madame de
Lorcy had resumed her attack on Princess Gulof, and the princess
had ended by consenting to delay her departure, to dine
with the adventurer of the green eyes, and to subject him to a
close scrutiny. There she was; yes, it was indeed she! The
first impulse of Samuel Brohl was to regain the door as speedily
as possible; but he did nothing of the kind. He looked at
Madame de Lorcy: she herself was regarding him with astonishment;
she wondered what could suddenly have overcome him;
she could find no explanation for the bewilderment apparent in
his countenance.</p>

<p>"It is a mere chance," he thought at last; "she has not
intentionally drawn me into a snare." This thought was productive
of a sort of half-relief.</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien!</i> what is it?" she asked. "Has my poor salon still
the misfortune to be hurtful to you?"</p>

<p>He pointed to a jardini&egrave;re, saying: "You are fond of hyacinths
and tuberoses; their perfume overpowered me for a
moment. I fear you think me very effeminate."</p>

<p>She replied in a caressing voice: "I take you for a most
worthy man who has terrible nerves; but you know by experience
that if you have weaknesses I have salts. Will you have
my smelling-bottle?"</p>

<p>"You are a thousand times too good," he rejoined, and
bravely marched forward to face the danger. It is a well-known
fact that dangers in a silken robe are the most formidable of all.</p>

<p>Madame de Lorcy presented him to the princess, who raised
her chin to examine him with her little glittering eyes. It
seemed to him that those gray orbs directed at him were two<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3612]</span>
balls, which struck him in the heart; he quivered from head to
foot and asked himself confusedly whether he were dead or living.
He soon perceived that he was still living; the princess
had remained impassible&mdash;not a muscle of her face had moved.
She ended by bestowing upon Samuel a smile which was almost
gracious, and addressing to him some insignificant words which
he only half understood, but which seemed to him exquisite&mdash;delicious.
He fancied that she was saying to him: "You have a
chance&mdash;you were born lucky; my sight has been impaired for
some years, and I do not recognize you. Bless your star, you
are saved!" He experienced such a transport of joy that he
could have flung his arms about the neck of Abb&eacute; Miollens, who
came up to him with extended hand, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What have you been thinking about, my dear count? Since
we last met a very great event has been accomplished. What
woman wishes, God wishes; but after all, my own humble efforts
were not without avail, and I am proud of it."</p>

<p>Madame de Lorcy requested Count Larinski to offer his arm
to Princess Gulof and lead her out to dinner. He mechanically
complied; but he had not the strength to utter a syllable as he
conducted the princess to table. She herself said nothing; she
seemed wholly busied in arranging with her unoccupied hand a
lock of her gray hair, which had strayed too far over her forehead.
He looked fixedly at this short plump hand, which one
day in a fit of jealous fury had administered to him two smart
blows; his cheeks recognized it.</p>

<p>During dinner the princess was very gay: she paid more
attention to Abb&eacute; Miollens than to Count Larinski; she took
pleasure in teasing the good priest&mdash;in endeavoring to shock
him a little. It was not easy to shock him; to his natural easy
good-nature he united an innate respect for grandeurs and for
princesses. She did not neglect so good an opportunity to air
her monkey-development theories. He merrily flung back the
ball; he declared that he should prefer to be a fallen angel
rather than a perfected monkey; that in his estimation a parvenu
made a much sorrier figure in the world than the descendant of
an old family of ruined nobility. She replied that she was more
democratic than he. "It is pleasant to me," said she, "to think
that I am a progressive ape, who has a wide future before him,
and who by taking proper pains may hope to attain new
advancement."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3613]</span></p>

<p>While they were thus chatting, Samuel Brohl was striving
with all his might to recover from the terrible blow he had
received. He noted with keen satisfaction that the eyesight of
the princess was considerably impaired; that the microscopic
studies for which she had always had a taste had resulted in rendering
her somewhat near-sighted; that she was obliged to look
out carefully to find her way among her wine-glasses. "She has
not seen me for six years," thought he, "and I have become a
different man; I have undergone a complete metamorphosis; I
have difficulty sometimes in recognizing myself. Formerly my
face was close-shaven; now I have let my entire beard grow.
My voice, my accent, the poise of my head, my manners, the
expression of my countenance, all are changed; Poland has entered
into my blood&mdash;I am Samuel no longer, I am Larinski."
He blessed the microscope, which enfeebled the sight of old
women; he blessed Count Abel Larinski, who had made of him
his twin brother. Before the end of the repast he had recovered
all his assurance, all his aplomb. He began to take part in the
conversation: he recounted in a sorrowful tone a sorrowful little
story; he retailed sundry playful anecdotes with a melancholy
grace and sprightliness; he expressed the most chivalrous sentiments;
shaking his lion's mane, he spoke of the prisoner at the
Vatican with tears in his voice. It were impossible to be a more
thorough Larinski.</p>

<p>The princess manifested, in listening to him, an astonished
curiosity; she concluded by saying to him, "Count, I admire
you; but I believe only in physiology, and you are a little too
much of a Pole for me."</p>

<p>After they had left the table and repaired to the salon, several
callers dropped in. It was like a deliverance to Samuel. If
the society was not numerous enough for him to lose himself in
it, at least it served him as a shield. He held it for a certainty
that the princess had not recognized him; yet he did not cease
feeling in her presence unutterably ill at ease. This Calmuck
visage of hers recalled to him all the miseries, the shame, the
hard grinding slavery of his youth; he could not look at her
without feeling his brow burn as though it were being seared
with a hot iron.</p>

<p>He entered into conversation with a supercilious, haughty,
and pedantic counselor-at-law, whose interminable monologues distilled
ennui. This fine speaker seemed charming to Samuel, who<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3614]</span>
found in him wit, knowledge, scholarship, and taste; he possessed
the (in his eyes) meritorious quality of not knowing Samuel
Brohl. For Samuel had come to divide the human race into two
categories: the first comprehended those well-to-do, thriving people
who did not know a certain Brohl; he placed in the second,
old women who did know him. He interrogated the counselor
with deference, he hung upon his words, he smiled with an air
of approbation at all the absurdities which escaped him; he
would have been willing to have his discourse last three hours
by the watch; if this charming bore had shown symptoms of
escaping him, he would have held him back by the button.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a harsh voice saying to Madame de
Lorcy, "Where is Count Larinski? Bring him to me; I want to
have a discussion with him."</p>

<p>He could not do otherwise than comply; he quitted his counselor
with regret, went over and took a seat in the arm-chair
that Madame de Lorcy drew up for him at the side of the princess,
and which had for him the effect of a stool of repentance.
Madame de Lorcy moved away, and he was left <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with
Princess Gulof, who said to him, "I have been told that congratulations
are due you, and I must make them at once&mdash;although
we are enemies."</p>

<p>"By what right are we enemies, princess?" he asked, with a
slightly troubled feeling, which quickly passed away as she
answered, "I am a Russian and you are a Pole; but we shall
have no time for fighting: I leave for London to-morrow morning
at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>He was on the point of casting himself at her feet and
tenderly kissing her two hands in testimony of his gratitude.
"To-morrow at seven o'clock," he mentally ejaculated. "I have
slandered her: she has some good in her."</p>

<p>"When I say that I am a Russian," resumed the princess,
"it is merely a formal speech. Love of country is a prejudice,
an idea which has had its day, which had sense in the times of
Epaminondas or of Theseus, but which has it no longer. We
live in the age of the telegraph, the locomotive; and I know of
nothing more absurd now than a frontier, or more ridiculous
than a patriot. Rumor says that you fought like a hero in the
insurrection of 1863; that you gave proof of incomparable
prowess, and that you killed with your own hand ten Cossacks.
What harm had they done you, those poor Cossacks? Do they<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3615]</span>
not sometimes haunt your dreams? Can you think of your
victims without disquietude and without remorse?"</p>

<p>He replied in a dry, haughty tone: "I really do not know,
princess, how many Cossacks I have killed; but I do know that
there are some subjects on which I do not love to expatiate."</p>

<p>"You are right&mdash;I should not comprehend you. Don Quixote
did not do Sancho the honor to explain himself to him
every day."</p>

<p>"Ah, I beg of you, let us talk a little of the man-monkey,"
he observed, in a rather more pliant tone than he had at first
assumed. "That is a question which has the advantage of being
neither Russian nor Polish."</p>

<p>"You will not succeed that way in throwing me off the track.
I mean to tell you all the evil I think of you, no matter how it
may incense you. You uttered, at table, theories which displeased
me. You are not only a Polish patriot,&mdash;you are an
idealist, a true disciple of Plato, and you do not know how I
have always detested this man. In all these sixty years that
I have been in this world, I have seen nothing but selfishness
and grasping after self-gratification. Twice during dinner you
spoke of an ideal world. What is an ideal world? Where is it
situated? You speak of it as of a house whose inhabitants you
are well acquainted with, whose key is in your pocket. Can
you show me the key? I promise not to steal it from you. O
Poet!&mdash;for you are quite as much of a poet as of a Pole, which
is not saying much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing remains but to hang me," he interposed, smilingly.</p>

<p>"No, I shall not hang you. Opinions are free, and there is
room enough in the world for all, even idealists. Besides, if you
were to be hanged, it would bring to the verge of despair a
charming girl who adores you, who was created expressly for
you, and whom you will shortly marry. When will the ceremony
take place?"</p>

<p>"If I dared hope that you would do me the honor of being
present, princess, I should postpone it until your return from
England."</p>

<p>"You are too amiable; but I could not on any consideration
retard the happiness of Mademoiselle Moriaz. There, my dear
count, I congratulate you sincerely. I had the pleasure to meet
here the future Countess Larinski. She is adorable! It is an
exquisite nature, hers&mdash;a true poet's wife. She must have<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3616]</span>
brains, discernment; she has chosen you that says everything.
As to her fortune, I dare not ask you if she has any; you would
turn away from me in disgust. Do idealists trouble their heads
with such vile questions?"</p>

<p>She leaned toward him, and fanning herself excitedly, added,
"These poor idealists! they have one misfortune."</p>

<p>"And what is that, princess?"</p>

<p>"They dream with open eyes, and the awakening is sometimes
disagreeable. Ah, my dear Count Larinski, this, that, and
the other, <i>et c&aelig;tera</i>. Thus endeth the adventure."</p>

<p>Then stretching out her neck until her face was close to his,
she darted at him a venomous viper-like look, and in a voice
that seemed to cut into his tympanum like a sharp-toothed saw,
she hissed, "Samuel Brohl, the man with the green eyes, sooner
or later the mountains must meet!"</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the candelabra on the mantel-piece
darted out jets of flame, whose green, blue, and rose-colored
tongues ascended to the ceiling; and it appeared to him as
though his heart was beating as noisily as a clock pendulum, and
that every one would turn to inquire whence came the noise.
But every one was occupied; no one turned round; no one suspected
that there was a man present on whom a thunderbolt had
just fallen.</p>

<p>The man passed his hand over his brow, which was covered
with a cold sweat; then dispelling by an effort of will the cloud
that veiled his eyes, he in turn leaned toward the princess and
with quivering lip and evil sardonic glance, said to her in a low
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Princess, I have a slight acquaintance with this Samuel
Brohl of whom you speak. He is not a man who will allow
himself to be strangled without a great deal of outcry. You are
not much in the habit of writing; nevertheless he received from
you two letters, which he copied, placing the originals in safety.
If ever he sees the necessity of appearing in a court of justice,
these two letters can be made to create quite a sensation, and
unquestionably they will be the delight of all the petty journals
of Paris."</p>

<p>Thereupon he made a profound bow, respectfully took leave
of Madame de Lorcy, and retired, followed by Abb&eacute; Miollens,
who inflicted a real torture by insisting on accompanying him to
the station.</p>

<h3><a name="SAMUEL_BROHL_GIVES_UP_THE_PLAY" id="SAMUEL_BROHL_GIVES_UP_THE_PLAY"></a>SAMUEL BROHL GIVES UP THE PLAY</h3>

<h4>From 'Samuel Brohl and Company'</h4>

<p>The gate opened and admitted Samuel Brohl, who had a smile
on his lips. His first words were&mdash;"And your umbrella!
You have forgotten it?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Moriaz replied, "Do you not see that there
is no sunshine?" And she remained leaning against the apple-tree.</p>

<p>He uplifted his hand to show her the blue sky; he let it fall
again. He looked at Antoinette, and he was afraid. He guessed
immediately that she knew all. At once he grew audacious.</p>

<p>"I spent a dull day yesterday," said he. "Madame de Lorcy
invited me to dine with a crazy woman; but the night made up
for it. I saw Engadine in my dreams&mdash;the firs, the Alpine
pines, the emerald lakes, and a red hood."</p>

<p>"I too dreamed last night. I dreamed that the bracelet you
gave me belonged to the crazy woman of whom you speak, and
that she had her name engraved on it."</p>

<p>She threw him the bracelet; he picked it up, examined it,
turned and re-turned it in his trembling fingers. She grew impatient.
"Look at the place that has been forced open. Don't you
know how to read?"</p>

<p>He read, and became stupefied. Who would have believed
that this trinket that he had found among his father's old traps
had come to him from Princess Gulof; that it was the price she
had paid for Samuel Brohl's ignominy and shame? Samuel was
a fatalist; he felt that his star had set, that Fate had conspired
to ruin his hopes, that he was found guilty and condemned. His
heart grew heavy within him.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me what I ought to think of a certain Samuel
Brohl?" she asked.</p>

<p>That name, pronounced by her, fell on him like a mass of
lead; he never would have believed that there could be so much
weight in a human word. He trembled under the blow; then he
struck his brow with his clinched hand and replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Samuel Brohl is a man as worthy of your pity as he is of
mine. If you knew all that he has suffered, all that he has
dared, you could not help deeply pitying and admiring him.
Listen to me: Samuel Brohl is an unfortunate man&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3618]</span></p>

<p>"Or a wretch!" she interrupted in a terrible voice. She was
seized by a fit of nervous laughter; she cried out, "Madame
Brohl! I will not be called Madame Brohl. Ah! that poor
Countess Larinski!"</p>

<p>He had a spasm of rage that would have terrified her had
she conjectured what agitated him. He raised his head, crossed
his arms on his breast, and said with a bitter smile, "It was not
the man that you loved, it was the count."</p>

<p>She replied, "The man whom I loved never lied."</p>

<p>"Yes, I lied," he cried, gasping for breath. "I drank that
cup of shame without remorse or disgust. I lied because I loved
you madly. I lied because you were dearer to me than my
honor. I lied because I despaired of touching your heart, and
any road seemed good that led to you. Why did I meet you?
why could I not see you without recognizing in you the dream
of my whole life? Happiness had passed me by, it was about
to take flight; I caught it in a trap&mdash;I lied. Who would not
lie, to be loved by you?"</p>

<p>Samuel Brohl had never looked so handsome. Despair and
passion kindled a sombre flame in his eyes; he had the sinister
charm of a fiery Satan. He fixed on Antoinette a fascinating
glance which said, "What matter my name, my lies, and the
rest? My face is not a mask, and I am the man who pleased
you." He had not the least suspicion of the astonishing facility
with which Antoinette had taken back the heart that she had
given away so easily; he did not suspect what miracles can be
wrought by contempt. In the Middle Ages people believed in
<i>golems</i>, figures in clay of an entrancing beauty, which had all
the appearance of life. Under a lock of hair was written, in
Hebrew characters, on their brow, the word "Truth." If they
chanced to lie, the word was obliterated; they lost all their
charm; the clay was no longer anything but clay.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Moriaz divined Samuel Brohl's thought; she
exclaimed, "The man I loved was he whose history you related
to me."</p>

<p>He would have liked to kill her, so that she should never
belong to another. Behind Antoinette, not twenty steps distant,
he descried the curb of a well, and grew dizzy at the sight. He
discovered with despair that he was not made of the stuff for
crime. He dropped down on his knees in the grass and cried,
"If you will not pardon me, nothing remains for me but to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3619]</span>
die!" She stood motionless and impassive. She repeated between
her teeth Camille Langis's phrase: "I am waiting until
this great comedian has finished playing his piece."</p>

<p>He rose and started to run toward the well. She was in
front of him and barred the passage, but at the same moment
she felt two hands clasp her waist, and the breath of two lips
which sought her lips and which murmured, "You love me still,
since you do not want me to die."</p>

<p>She struggled with violence and horror; she succeeded by a
frantic effort in disengaging herself from his grasp. She fled
toward the house. Samuel Brohl rushed after her in mad pursuit;
he was just reaching her, when he suddenly stopped. He
had caught sight of M. Langis, hurrying from out a thicket,
where he had been hidden. Growing uneasy, he had approached
the orchard through a path concealed by the heavy foliage. Antoinette,
out of breath, ran to him, gasping, "Camille, save me
from this man!" and she threw herself into his arms, which
closed about her with delight. He felt her sink; she would have
fallen had he not supported her.</p>

<p>At the same instant a menacing voice saluted him with the
words, "Monsieur, we will meet again!"</p>

<p>"To-day, if you will," he replied.</p>

<p>Antoinette's wild excitement had given place to insensibility;
she neither saw nor heard; her limbs no longer sustained her.
Camille had great difficulty in bringing her to the house; she
could not ascend the steps of the terrace; he was obliged to
carry her. Mademoiselle Moiseney saw him, and filled the air
with her cries. She ran forward, she lavished her best care on
her queen. All the time she was busy in bringing her to her
senses she was asking Camille for explanations, to which she
did not pay the least attention; she interrupted him at every
word to exclaim:&mdash;"This has been designed, and you are at the
bottom of the plot. I have suspected you&mdash;you owe Antoinette
a grudge. Your wounded vanity has never recovered from her
refusal, and you are determined to be revenged. Perhaps you
flatter yourself that she will end by loving you. She does not
love you, and she never will love you. Who are you, to dare
compare yourself with Count Larinski?... Be silent!...
Do I believe in Samuel Brohl? I do not know Samuel
Brohl. I venture my head that there is no such person as
Samuel Brohl."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3620]</span></p>

<p>"Not much of a venture, mademoiselle," replied M. Moriaz,
who had arrived in the mean time.</p>

<p>Antoinette remained during an hour in a state of mute languor;
then a violent fever took possession of her. When the
physician who had been sent for arrived, M. Langis accompanied
him into the chamber of the sick girl. She was delirious:
seated upright, she kept continually passing her hand over her
brow; she sought to efface the taint of a kiss she had received
one moonlight night, and the impression in her hair of the flapping
of a bat's wings that had caught in her hood. These two
things were confounded in her memory. From time to time
she said, "Where is my portrait? Give me my portrait."</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock when M. Langis called on Samuel
Brohl, who was not astonished to see him appear; he had hoped
he would come. Samuel had regained self-possession. He was
calm and dignified. However, the tempest through which he
had gone had left on his features some vestige of its passage.
His lips quivered, and his beautiful chestnut locks curled like
serpents about his temples and gave his head a Medusa-like
appearance.</p>

<p>He said to Camille, "Where and when? Our seconds will
undertake the arrangement of the rest."</p>

<p>"You mistake, monsieur, the motive of my visit," replied M.
Langis. "I am grieved to destroy your illusions, but I did not
come to arrange a meeting with you."</p>

<p>"Do you refuse to give me satisfaction?"</p>

<p>"What satisfaction do I owe you?"</p>

<p>"You insulted me."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"And you said, 'The day, the place, the weapons. I leave
all to your choice.'"</p>

<p>M. Langis could not refrain from smiling. "Ah! you at last
acknowledge that your fainting fit was comedy?" he rejoined.</p>

<p>"Acknowledge on your part," replied Samuel, "that you
insult persons when you believe that they are not in a state to
hear you. Your courage likes to take the safe side."</p>

<p>"Be reasonable," replied Camille. "I placed myself at Count
Larinski's disposal: you cannot require me to fight with a Samuel
Brohl!"</p>

<p>Samuel sprang to his feet; with fierce bearing and head erect
he advanced to the young man, who awaited him unflinchingly,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3621]</span>
and whose resolute manner awed him. He cast upon him a
sinister look, turned and reseated himself, bit his lips until the
blood came; then said in a placid voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you do me the favor of telling me, monsieur, to what
I owe the honor of this visit?"</p>

<p>"I came to demand of you a portrait that Mademoiselle
Moriaz is desirous of having returned."</p>

<p>"If I refuse to give it up, you will doubtless appeal to my
delicacy?"</p>

<p>"Do you doubt it?" ironically replied Camille.</p>

<p>"That proves, monsieur, that you still believe in Count
Larinski; that it is to him you speak at this moment."</p>

<p>"You deceive yourself. I came to see Samuel Brohl, who is
a business man, and it is a commercial transaction that I intend
to hold with him." And drawing from his pocket a portemonnaie,
he added, "You see I do not come empty-handed."</p>

<p>Samuel settled himself in his arm-chair. Half closing his eyes,
he watched M. Langis through his eye-lashes. A change passed
over his features: his nose became more crooked, and his chin
more pointed; he no longer resembled a lion,&mdash;he was a fox.
His lips wore the sugared smile of a usurer, one who lays snares
for the sons of wealthy families, and who scents out every favorable
case. If at this moment Jeremiah Brohl had seen him from
the other world, he would have recognized his own flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>He said at last to Camille, "You are a man of understanding,
monsieur; I am ready to listen to you."</p>

<p>"I am very glad of it, and to speak frankly, I had no doubts
about it. I knew you to be very intelligent, very much disposed
to make the best of an unpleasant conjuncture."</p>

<p>"Ah! spare my modesty. I thank you for your excellent opinion
of me; I should warn you that I am accused of being greedy
after gain. You will leave some of the feathers from your wings
between my fingers."</p>

<p>For a reply M. Langis significantly patted the portemonnaie
which he held in his hand, and which was literally stuffed with
bank-notes. Immediately Samuel took from a locked drawer a
casket, and proceeded to open it.</p>

<p>"This is a very precious gem," he said. "The medallion is
gold, and the work on the miniature is exquisite. It is a masterpiece&mdash;the
color equals the design. The mouth is marvelously<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3622]</span>
rendered. Mengs or Liotard could not have done better. At
what do you value this work of art?"</p>

<p>"You are more of a connoisseur than I. I will leave it to
your own valuation."</p>

<p>"I will let you have the trinket for five thousand francs; it is
almost nothing."</p>

<p>Camille began to draw out the five thousand francs from his
portemonnaie. "How prompt you are!" remarked Samuel. "The
portrait has not only a value as a work of art; I am sure you
attach a sentimental value to it, for I suspect you of being over
head and ears in love with the original."</p>

<p>"I find you too greedy," replied Camille, casting on him a
crushing glance.</p>

<p>"Do not be angry. I am accustomed to exercise methodical
precision in business affairs. My father always sold at a fixed
price, and I too never lower my charges. You will readily
understand that what is worth five thousand francs to a friend is
worth double to a lover. The gem is worth ten thousand francs.
You can take it or leave it."</p>

<p>"I will take it," replied M. Langis.</p>

<p>"Since we agree," continued Samuel, "I possess still other
articles which might suit you."</p>

<p>"Why, do you think of selling me your clothing?"</p>

<p>"Let us come to an understanding. I have other articles of
the same lot."</p>

<p>And he brought from a closet the red hood, which he spread
out on the table.</p>

<p>"Here is an article of clothing&mdash;to use your own words&mdash;that
may be of interest to you. Its color is beautiful; if you
saw it in the sunshine, it would dazzle you. I grant that the
stuff is common&mdash;it is very ordinary cashmere&mdash;but if you
deign to examine it closely, you will be struck by the peculiar
perfume that it exhales. The Italians call it '<i>l'odor femminino</i>.'"</p>

<p>"And what is your rate of charge for the '<i>odor femminino</i>'?"</p>

<p>"I will be moderate. I will let you have this article and its
perfume for five thousand francs. It is actually giving it away."</p>

<p>"Assuredly. We will say ten and five&mdash;that makes fifteen
thousand."</p>

<p>"One moment. You can pay for all together. I have other
things to offer you.&mdash;One would say that the floor burned your
feet, and that you could not endure being in this room."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3623]</span></p>

<p>"I allow that I long to leave this&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;this
shop, lair, or den."</p>

<p>"You are young, monsieur: it never does to hurry; haste
causes us acts of forgetfulness which we afterward regret. You
would be very sorry not to take away with you these two scraps
of paper."</p>

<p>At these words he drew from his note-book two letters, which
he unfolded.</p>

<p>"Is there much more?" demanded Camille. "I fear that
I shall become short of funds, and be obliged to go back for
more."</p>

<p>"Ah, these two letters! I will not part with them for a trifle;
the second especially. It is only twelve lines in length; but
what pretty English handwriting! Only see! and the style is
loving and tender. I will add that it is signed. Ah, monsieur,
Mademoiselle Moriaz will be charmed to see these scrawls again.
Under what obligations will she be to you! You will make the
most of it; you will tell her that you wrested them from me,
your dagger at my throat&mdash;that you terrified me. With what a
gracious smile she will reward your heroism! According to my
opinion that smile is as well worth ten thousand francs as the
medallion&mdash;the two gems are of equal value."</p>

<p>"If you want more, it makes no difference."</p>

<p>"No, monsieur; I have told you I have only one price."</p>

<p>"At this rate, it is twenty-five thousand francs that I owe you.
You have nothing more to sell me?"</p>

<p>"Alas! that is all."</p>

<p>"Will you swear it?"</p>

<p>"What, monsieur! you admit then that Samuel Brohl has
a word of honor&mdash;that when he has sworn he can be believed?"</p>

<p>"You are right; I am still very young."</p>

<p>"That is all, then, I swear to you," affirmed Samuel, sighing.
"My shop is poorly stocked; I had commenced laying in a
supply, but an unfortunate accident deranged my little business."</p>

<p>"Bah! be consoled," replied M. Langis; "you will find
another opportunity: a genius of such lofty flights as yours is
never at a loss. You have been unfortunate; some day Fortune
will compensate you for the wrongs she has done you, and the
world will accord justice to your fine talents."</p>

<p>Speaking thus, he laid on the table twenty-five notes of a
thousand francs each. He counted them; Samuel counted them<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3624]</span>
after him, and at once delivered to him the medallion, the hood,
and the two letters.</p>

<p>Camille rose to leave. "Monsieur Brohl," he said, "from the
first day I saw you, I formed the highest opinion of your character.
The reality surpasses my expectations. I am charmed
to have made your acquaintance, and I venture to hope that
you are not sorry to have made mine. However, I shall not
say <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" replied Samuel, suddenly changing his countenance
and attitude. And he added, "If you are fond of being
astonished, monsieur, will you remain still another instant in this
den?"</p>

<p>He rolled and twisted the twenty-five one-thousand-franc notes
into lamp-lighters; then with a grand gesture, <i>&agrave; la</i> Poniatowski,
he approached the candle, held them in the flame until they
blazed, and then threw them on the hearth, where they were
soon consumed.</p>

<p>Turning toward M. Langis, he cried, "Will you now do me
the honor of fighting with me?"</p>

<p>"After such a noble act as that, I can refuse you nothing,"
returned Camille. "I will do you that signal honor."</p>

<p>"Just what I desire," replied Samuel. "I am the offended;
I have the choice of arms." And in showing M. Langis out, he
said, "I will not conceal from you that I have frequented the
shooting galleries, and that I am a first-class pistol-shot."</p>

<p>Camille bowed and went out.</p>

<p>The next day, in a lucid interval, Mademoiselle Moriaz saw
at the foot of her bed a medallion laid on a red hood. From
that moment the physician announced an improvement in her
symptoms.</p>

<h2><a name="LORD_CHESTERFIELD" id="LORD_CHESTERFIELD"></a>LORD CHESTERFIELD</h2>

<h4>(1694-1773)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capa.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">s the best representative of a creditable type among English
noblemen in the reign of George II.,&mdash;an accomplished
courtier, a diplomatic statesman worthy of reliance on occasions
of emergency, a scholar, and a patron of literature,&mdash;Philip
Dormer Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield, occupied a prominent
place in the history of his country for more than forty years. He
was the eldest son of Philip, third earl, and was born at London in
1694. Most of his boyhood was spent under the care of his grandmother,
the Marchioness of Halifax. When eighteen, he was entered
at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became "an excellent classical
scholar." The principal events in his public career were his election
to Parliament in his twenty-first year; his appointment as Captain of
the Yeomen of the Guard in return for a political vote; his selection
for special service as Ambassador to The Hague after his succession
to the family title; his appointment as Lord High Steward, with the
Garter, as a reward for his success in Holland; his expulsion from
that position by Horace Walpole for political disobedience in opposing
an excise bill; his second successful mission to The Hague; his
selection, as a reward, for the responsible post of Viceroy in Ireland,
and subsequently his resignation and acceptance of office as Secretary
of State, this latter appointment being taken when the Earl
had reached his fiftieth year. Chesterfield was first a warm friend,
then a bitter enemy of Horace Walpole. He also antagonized George
II., but that monarch finally succumbed to diplomatic treatment at
his hands and offered his former antagonist a dukedom, which was
courteously declined. In his fifty-eighth year, partial deafness caused
him to withdraw almost wholly from public affairs. In diplomacy,
his successful missions to The Hague made him strong with officials
in power. His ability as a statesman was shown to great advantage
in a firm yet popular administration of Irish affairs during a critical
period in Irish history. As a patron of literature, Dr. Samuel Johnson
deemed him a distinct failure, and expressed this opinion forcibly to
that effect in his celebrated letter. His literary reputation rests
chiefly on letters addressed to his natural son Philip, who died in
his thirty-sixth year, greatly to his father's disappointment, he having
looked forward to a great career for the young man. His letters
of counsel and advice were to that end; oddly, they left the recipient<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3626]</span>
still shy, awkward, tactless, and immature. These epistles, not intended
for public perusal, were subsequently printed in book form.</p>

<p>The Earl of Chesterfield died in 1773. Four years after his death,
'Miscellaneous Works' were published in two volumes, also 'Characters.'
'The Art of Pleasing' and 'Letters to His Heir' appeared
ten years from the date of his decease, and this was followed, a
few months later, by 'Memoirs of Asiaticus.'</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_LETTERS_TO_HIS_SON" id="FROM_LETTERS_TO_HIS_SON"></a>FROM 'LETTERS TO HIS SON'</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Concerning Manners</span></h3>

<p>There is a <i>biens&eacute;ance</i> with regard to people of the lowest
degree; a gentleman observes it with his footman, even
with the beggar in the street. He considers them as objects
of compassion, not of insult; he speaks to neither <i>d'un ton
brusque</i>, but corrects the one coolly, and refuses the other with
humanity. There is no one occasion in the world, in which <i>le
ton brusque</i> is becoming a gentleman. In short, <i>les biens&eacute;ances</i>
are another word for <i>manners</i>, and extend to every part of life.
They are propriety; the Graces should attend in order to complete
them: the Graces enable us to do genteelly and pleasingly
what <i>les biens&eacute;ances</i> require to be done at all. The latter are an
obligation upon every man; the former are an infinite advantage
and ornament to any man.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Control of One's Countenance</span></h3>

<p>People unused to the world have babbling countenances, and
are unskillful enough to show what they have sense enough not
to tell. In the course of the world, a man must very often put
on an easy, frank countenance, upon very disagreeable occasions;
he must seem pleased, when he is very much otherwise; he must
be able to accost and receive with smiles those whom he would
much rather meet with swords. In Courts he must not turn
himself inside out. All this may, nay, must be done, without
falsehood and treachery: for it must go no further than politeness
and manners, and must stop short of assurances and professions
of simulated friendship. Good manners to those one does not
love are no more a breach of truth than "your humble servant,"
at the bottom of a challenge, is; they are universally agreed upon
and understood to be things of course. They are necessary
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3627]</span>guards of the decency and peace of society: they must only act
defensively; and then not with arms poisoned with perfidy.
Truth, but not the whole truth, must be the invariable principle
of every man who hath either religion, honor, or prudence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dress as an Index to Character</span></h3>

<p>I cannot help forming some opinion of a man's sense
and character from his dress; and I believe most people do
as well as myself. Any affectation whatsoever in dress implies
in my mind a flaw in the understanding.... A man of
sense carefully avoids any particular character in his dress; he is
accurately clean for his own sake; but all the rest is for other
people's. He dresses as well, and in the same manner, as the
people of sense and fashion of the place where he is. If he
dresses better, as he thinks,&mdash;that is, more than they,&mdash;he is a
fop; if he dresses worse, he is unpardonably negligent: but of
the two, I would rather have a young fellow too much than too
little dressed: the excess on that side will wear off with a little
age and reflection; but if he is negligent at twenty, he will be a
sloven at forty and stink at fifty years old. Dress yourself fine
where others are fine, and plain where others are plain; but take
care always that your clothes are well made and fit you, for
otherwise they will give you a very awkward air. When you
are once well dressed for the day, think no more of it afterwards;
and without any stiffness or fear of discomposing that
dress, let all your motions be as easy and natural as if you had
no clothes on at all.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Remarks on Good Breeding</span></h3>

<p>A friend of yours and mine has justly defined good breeding
to be "the result of much good sense, some good nature, and
a little self-denial for the sake of others, and with a view to
obtain the same indulgence from them." Taking this for granted
(as I think it cannot be disputed), it is astonishing to me that
anybody who had good sense and good nature (and I believe
you have both) can essentially fail in good breeding. As to the
modes of it, indeed, they vary according to persons, places, and
circumstances, and are only to be acquired by observation and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3628]</span>
experience; but the substance of it is everywhere and eternally
the same. Good manners are to particular societies what good
morals are to society in general&mdash;their cement and their security.
And as laws are enacted to enforce good morals, or at least
to prevent the ill effects of bad ones, so there are certain rules
of civility, universally implied and received, to enforce good
manners and punish bad ones. And indeed there seems to me
to be less difference, both between the crimes and punishments,
than at first one would imagine.... Mutual complaisances,
attentions, and sacrifices of little conveniences, are as natural
an implied compact between civilized people as protection and
obedience are between kings and subjects: whoever in either
case violates that compact, justly forfeits all advantages arising
from it. For my own part, I really think that next to the consciousness
of doing a good action, that of doing a civil one is the
most pleasing: and the epithet which I should covet the most,
next to that of Aristides, would be that of "well-bred."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CHOICE_OF_A_VOCATION" id="THE_CHOICE_OF_A_VOCATION"></a>THE CHOICE OF A VOCATION</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">From 'Miscellaneous Works'</span></h3>

<p>It is very certain that no man is fit for everything; but it is
almost as certain too that there is scarce any one man who
is not fit for something, which something nature plainly
points out to him by giving him a tendency and propensity to
it. I look upon common-sense to be to the mind what conscience
is to the heart,&mdash;the faithful and constant monitor of
what is right or wrong. And I am convinced that no man commits
either a crime or a folly but against the manifest and
sensible representations of the one or the other. Every man
finds in himself, either from nature or education,&mdash;for they are
hard to distinguish,&mdash;a peculiar bent and disposition to some
particular character; and his struggling against it is the fruitless
and endless labor of Sisyphus. Let him follow and cultivate
that vocation, he will succeed in it, and be considerable in one
way at least; whereas if he departs from it he will at best be
inconsiderable, probably ridiculous.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LITERATURE_OF_CHINA" id="THE_LITERATURE_OF_CHINA"></a>THE LITERATURE OF CHINA</h2>

<h4>BY ROBERT K. DOUGLAS</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he distinguishing feature and the crowning glory of the Chinese
nation is its literature. It is true that the Chinese can
boast of an ancient empire, of a time-honored civilization, of
conquests in the fields of science, and, in spite of recent events, in
the field of battle; but in the mind of every true Son of Han these
titles to fame sink into insignificance before that of the possession of
a literature which dates back to a time when the Western world was
yet in a state of barbarism, and which as centuries have rolled by
has been worthily supplemented in every
branch of knowledge.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">
<img src="images/confucius.jpg" width="168" height="202" alt="Confucius" title="Confucius" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Confucius</span></span>
</div>

<p>It may now be accepted as beyond dispute
that the Chinese migrated into China
from southwestern Asia about B.C. 2300,
bringing with them a knowledge of writing,
and in all probability the beginnings of a
literature. In the records of that distant
past, history and fable are so closely intermingled
that it is difficult to pronounce
definitely upon any subject treated in them,
and we are compelled to seek in comparative
philology for reasonable explanations
of many points which Chinese chroniclers
are content to leave, not from want of assertion,
in the mists of uncertainty.</p>

<p>By common consent it is acknowledged that the 'Yi King,'
Book of Changes, is the oldest work extant in Chinese literature;
though other works, the names of which only have come down to us,
were contemporaneously current in the country. A peculiar veneration
is naturally felt by the Chinese for this sole surviving waif from
a past literature; and from the time of Confucius downward, scholars
of every age have attempted to explain its mystic pages. The basis
of the work is popularly believed to be eight diagrams, which are
said to have been designed by Fuh-hi (B.C. 2852), and which by subdivision
have become multiplied into sixty-four. One of these stands
at the head of each of the sixty-four chapters into which the work
is now divided. Following these diagrams is in each case an initial
character, with short phrases which have been held by Confucius and
every subsequent native commentator to explain the meaning of the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3630]</span>
diagrams. But the key to the puzzle was denied to these scholars,
who made confusion worse confounded by their attempts to make
sense of that which was unintelligible to them. So mysterious a text
was naturally believed to be a work on divination; and accepting
this cue, the commentators devoted their energies to forcing into the
Procrustean bed of divination the disjointed phrases which follow the
diagrams. The solution of the mystery, which had escaped the keen
study of five-and-twenty centuries of native scholars, was discovered
by the late Professor Terrieu de la Couperie, who by many irrefragable
proofs demonstrated that the 'Yi King' consists "of old fragments
of early times in China, mostly of a lexical character." With
this explanation the futility of the attempts of the native scholars
to translate it as a connected text at once becomes apparent. A
large proportion of the chapters are merely syllabaries, similar to
those of Chaldea. The initial character represents the word to be
explained, and the phrases following express its various meanings.</p>

<p>An excellent translation of the 'Yi King' as it is understood by
native scholars was published by Professor Legge in 'The Sacred
Books of the East' (1882); and a comparison of his translation of
the seventh chapter with Professor T. de la Couperie's rendering of
the same passage must be enough to convince the most skeptical
that even if he is not absolutely correct, the native scholars must
undoubtedly be wrong. The chapter is headed by a diagram consisting
of five divided lines and one undivided; and the initial character
is Sze, which is described in modern dictionaries as meaning
"a teacher," "instructor," "model," "an army," "a poet," "a multitude,"
"the people," "all," "laws," "an elder." Of the phrases
which follow, Professor Legge gives the following rendering:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sze indicates how, in the case which it supposes, with firmness and correctness,
and [a leader of] age and experience, there will be good fortune
and no error.</p>

<p>"The first line, divided, shows the host going forward according to the
rules [for such a movement]. If these be not good, there will be evil.</p>

<p>"The second line, undivided, shows [the leader] in the midst of his host.
There will be good fortune and no error. The king has thrice conveyed to
him the orders [of his favor].</p>

<p>"The third line, divided, shows how the host may possibly have many
inefficient leaders. There will be evil.</p>

<p>"The fourth line, divided, shows the host in retreat. There is no error.</p>

<p>"The fifth line, divided, shows birds in the fields, which it will be advantageous
to seize and destroy. In that case there will be no error. If the
oldest son leads the host, and younger men [idly occupy offices assigned to
them], however firm and correct he may be, there will be evil.</p>

<p>"The topmost line, divided, shows the great ruler delivering his charges
[appointing some], to be rulers of States, and others to undertake the headship
of clans; but small men should not be employed [in such positions]."</p>

<p>It is impossible to read such an extract as the above without
being convinced that the explanation was not that which was
intended by the author or authors; and on the doctrine of probabilities,
a perusal of the following version by Professor T. de la Couperie
would incline us to accept his conclusions. But his theory
does not rest on probabilities alone; he is able to support it with
many substantial proofs: and though exception may possibly be
taken to some of his renderings of individual phrases, his general
views may be held to be firmly established. This is his version of
the chapter quoted above, with the exception of the words of good
or ill omen:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sze [is] a righteous great man. The Sze defines laws not biased. The
centre of the army. The three conveying orders [officers] of the Sovereign.
Sze [is] also corpse-like. Sze [is] an assistant officer. In the fields are birds
[so called]; many take the name [?] The elder sons [are] the leaders of the
army. The younger [are] the passive multitude [?] Great Princes instructing.
The group of men who have helped in the organization of the kingdom.
People gathered by the Wu flag [?]."</p>

<p>From what has been said, as well as from the above extracts, it
will be observed that to all except the native scholars who imagine
that they see in its pages deep divinatory lore, the chief interest of
the 'Yi King' lies in the linguistic and ethnographical indications
which it contains, and which at present we can but dimly discern.
It is difficult to assign a date to it, but it is certain that it existed
before the time of King W&ecirc;n (B.C. 1143), who with his son the
Duke of Chow edited the text and added a commentary to it. That
parts of it are very much earlier than this period there can be no
doubt; and it is safe to assume that in the oldest portion of the
work we have one of the first literary efforts of the Chinese. It was
not, however, until the time of Confucius that the foundations of the
national literature may be said to have been laid.</p>

<p>From constant references in the early histories it is obvious that
before that period a literature of a certain kind existed. The Chinese
have an instinctive love of letters, and we know from the records
that to the courts of the various princes were attached historians
whose duty it was to collect the folk-lore songs of the people of the
various States. "If a man were permitted to make all the ballads of
a nation, he need not care who should make its laws," said Sir Andrew
Fletcher of Saltoun. So thought the Chinese legislators, who
designed their enactments with direct regard to the dispositions of
the people as displayed in their songs. At the time of Confucius
(B.C. 551-479) a large collection of these ballads existed in the
archives of the sovereign State of Chow; and as is generally believed,
the sage revised the collection, and omitting those he considered<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3632]</span>
unworthy of preservation, formed an edition containing three hundred
and five pieces. This work has come down to us under the
title of the 'Shih King' or Book of Odes. The ballads are just such
as we should expect to find under the circumstances. They are
plainly the utterances of the people in a primitive state of civilization,
who nevertheless enjoyed considerable freedom; and though
they occasionally had to lament the tyranny of individual princes,
they cannot be described as having been among the down-trodden
nations of the earth. The domesticity which is still a distinctive
feature of Chinese life figures largely in them, and the filial piety
which to the present day is so highly esteemed finds constant expression.
The measure in which the odes have been handed down
to us makes it difficult to understand how any rhythm could be
found in them. With few exceptions they are all written in lines
of four characters each, and as read at the present day, consist
therefore of only four syllables. This seems to be so stunted and
unnatural a metre that one is inclined to accept Professor T. de la
Couperie's suggestion, for which he had much to say,&mdash;that at the
time at which they were sung, the characters which now represent
a syllable each were polysyllabic. It would seem probable that certainly
in some cases compound characters were pronounced as compounded
of syllables in accordance with their component parts, as
certain of them are read by the Japanese at the present time.
Numerous translations of the odes into European languages have
been made, and the following extracts from Professor Legge's rendering
of the second ode, celebrating the industry and filial piety
of the reigning queen, give a good idea of the general tone of the
pieces.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet was the scene. The spreading dolichos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extended far, down to the valley's depths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With leaves luxuriant. The orioles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fluttered around, and on the bushy trees<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which of them need be rinsed? and which need not?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My parents dear to visit back I go."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such were the odes which Confucius found collected ready to
his hand; and faithful to his character of transmitter of the wisdom
of the ancients, he made them the common property of his countrymen.
But these were not the only records at the court of Chow
which attracted his attention. He found there historical documents,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3633]</span>
containing the leading events in the history of the Chinese States
from the middle of the twenty-third century B.C. to 721. These curious
records of a past time possessed an irresistible attraction for him.
By constant study he made them his own, and with loving care collated
and edited the texts. These fragments are, from a historical
point of view, of great value; and they incidentally furnish evidence
of the fact that China was not always the stage on which the Chinese
people have played their parts. There is no sign in these records of
the first steps in ethics and science which one would expect to find
in the primitive history of a race. The utterances of the sovereigns
and sages, with which they abound, are marked by a comparatively
matured knowledge and an advanced ethical condition. The knowledge
of astronomy displayed, though not profound, is considerable,
and the directions given by the Emperor Yao to his astronomers
royal are quite such as may have been given by any Emperor of
China until the advent of the Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth
century; and the moral utterances of the sovereigns and their ministers
are on a par with the sentiments expressed in the Peking
Gazette at the present time. "Virtue," said the minister Yi addressing
his Emperor Y&uuml;, "is the basis of good government; and this
consists first in procuring for the people the things necessary for
their sustenance, such as water, fire, metals, wood, and grain. The
ruler must also think of rendering them virtuous, and of preserving
them from whatever can injure life and health. When you would
caution them, use gentle words; when you would correct, employ
authority." "Do not be ashamed of mistakes, and thus make them
crimes," was another piece of advice uttered forty centuries ago,
which has a peculiarly modern ring about it.</p>

<p>According to the system in vogue at the Chinese courts, the duty
of recording historical events was confided to historians of the right
hand and of the left. To the latter was given the duty of recording
the speeches and edicts of the sovereigns and their ministers, and to
the first that of compiling chronicles of events. The historians who
had placed on record the documents which Confucius edited in the
'Shu King' or Book of History were historians of the left hand, and
in the only original work which we have by the Sage&mdash;'The Spring
and Autumn Annals'&mdash;he constituted himself a historian of the right.
In this work he traces the history of his native State of Lu from the
year B.C. 722 to B.C. 484, and in the baldest and most calendar-like
style enumerates, without any comment or expression of opinion, the
facts which he considers of sufficient importance to report. However
faulty we may consider his manner of treatment, any criticism should
be leveled against the system rather than against the author. But
in other respects Confucius cannot shelter himself under the plea of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3634]</span>
usage. As a historian, it was his bounden duty above all things to
tell the truth, and to distribute praise and blame without fear or
favor. In this elementary duty Confucius failed, and has left us a
record in which he has obviously made events to chime in with his
preconceived ideas and opinions. Considering the assumption of virtue
with which Confucius always clothed himself, this is the more
noticeable; and still more is it remarkable that his disciples should
be so overcome by the glamour which attached to his name, that his
obvious lapses from the truth are not only left unnoted, but the general
tone and influence of the work are described in the most eulogistic
terms. "The world," said Mencius, "had fallen into decay and
right principles had dwindled away. Perverse discourses and oppressive
deeds had again waxen rife. Cases had occurred of ministers
who had murdered their rulers, and of sons who had murdered their
fathers. Confucius was afraid and made the 'Ch'un ch'iu.'" So
great, we are told, was the effect of the appearance of this work
that "rebellious ministers quaked with fear, and undutiful sons were
overcome with terror." Love of truth is not a characteristic of the
Chinese people; and unhappily their greatest men, Confucius among
them, have shown their countrymen a lamentable example in this
respect.</p>

<p>So great is the admiration of the people for this work of Confucius
that by universal consent the 'Ch'un ch'iu' has through all
ages been included among the Five Classics of the country. Three
others have already been spoken of, and there remains only one
more, the Book of Rites, to mention. This work is the embodiment
of, and authority for, the ceremonial which influences the national
policy of the country, and directs the individual destinies of the
people. We are informed on the highest authority that there are
three hundred rules of ceremony and three thousand rules of behavior.
Under a code so overwhelmingly oppressive, it is difficult to imagine
how the race can continue to exist; but five-and-twenty centuries of
close attention to the Book of Rites have so molded the nation
within the lines of the ceremonial which it prescribes, that acquiescence
with its rules has become a second nature with the people, and
requires no more guiding effort on their part than does the automatic
action of the nerves and limbs at the bidding of the brain. Within
its voluminous pages every act which one man should perform to
another is carefully and fully provided for; and this applies not only
to the daily life of the people, but also to the official acts of the
whole hierarchy of power from the Emperor downward. No court
ceremony is undertaken without its guidance, and no official deed is
done throughout the length and breadth of the eighteen Provinces of
the Empire without its sanction. Its spirit penetrates every Yam&ecirc;n<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3635]</span>
and permeates every household. It regulates the sacrifices which
should be offered to the gods, it prescribes the forms to be observed
by the Son of Heaven in his intercourse with his ministers, it lays
down the behavior proper to officials of all ranks, and it directs the
conduct of the people in every relation of life. It supplements in a
practical form the teachings of Confucius and others, and forms the
most important link in the chain which binds the people to the
chariot wheels of the "Sages."</p>

<p>Of canonical authority equal to the Five Classics if not greater,
are the 'Four Books' in which are recorded the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of
Confucius. These are the 'Luny&uuml;' or Sayings of Confucius, twenty
books, which contains a detailed description of the Sage's system
of philosophy; the 'Ta Hsio,' the Great Learning, ten chapters;
the 'Chung yung,' or the Doctrine of the Mean, thirty-three chapters;
and the development of Confucianism as enunciated by his great
follower Mencius in the 'M&ecirc;ng tz&#365;,' seven books. These works cover
the whole field of Confucianism; and as such, their contents claim
the allegiance and demand the obedience of ninety-nine out of every
hundred Chinamen. To the European student their contents are
somewhat disappointing. The system they enunciate wants completeness
and life, although the sentiments they express are unexceptionable;
as for example when Confucius said: "Hold faithfulness and
sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself.
When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them." Admirable
maxims such as these flowed from his lips in abundance, but he
could offer no reason why a man should rather obey the advice
thus presented than his own inclination. He had no reward to offer
for virtue, and no terrors with which to threaten the doers of evil.
In no sense do his teachings as they came from his lips constitute
a religion. He inculcated no worship of the Deity, and he refrained
altogether from declaring his belief or disbelief in a future existence.</p>

<p>The author of the 'Great Learning,' commonly said to be the
disciple Ts&ecirc;ng, describes the object of his work to be "to illustrate
illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest
excellence." And following on the lines indicated by his great master,
he lays down the ethical means by which these admirable ends
may in his opinion be attained. The 'Doctrine of the Mean' takes
for its text the injunction, "Let the states of equilibrium and harmony
exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout
heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish."
The author of this work, Tz&#365;ss&#365;, goes deeper into the motives of
human conduct than Confucius himself. "First he shows clearly how
the path of duty is to be traced to its origin in Heaven, and is
unchangeable, while the substance of it is provided in ourselves, and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3636]</span>
may not be departed from. Next he speaks of the importance of
preserving and nourishing this, and of exercising a watchful self-scrutiny
with reference to it. Finally he speaks of the meritorious
achievements and transforming influence of sage and spiritual men
in their highest extent."</p>

<p>In the teachings of Mencius (B.C. 372-289) we see a distinct
advance on the doctrines of Confucius. He was a man of a far more
practical frame of mind than his great predecessor, and possessed the
courage necessary to speak plainly in the presence of kings and
rulers. His knowledge of political economy was considerable, and he
brought to the test of experience many of the opinions and doctrines
which Confucius was willing to express only in the abstract. Filial
piety was his constant theme. "The richest fruit of benevolence is
this," he said,&mdash;"the service of one's parents. The richest fruit of
righteousness is this,&mdash;the obeying of one's elder brothers. The
richest fruit of wisdom is this,&mdash;the knowing of these two things,
and not departing from them."</p>

<p>These Five Classics and Four Books may be said to be the
foundations on which all Chinese literature has been based. The
period when Confucius and Mencius taught and wrote was one of
great mental activity all over the world. While the wise men of
China were proclaiming their system of philosophy, the Seven Sages
of Greece were pouring out words of wisdom in the schools at Athens,
and the sound of the voice of Buddha (died 480 B.C.) had
hardly ceased to be heard under the b&ocirc;dhi tree in Central India.
From such beginnings arose the literatures which have since added
fame and splendor to the three countries in Asia and Europe. In
China the impetus given by these pioneers of learning was at once
felt, and called into existence a succession of brilliant writers who
were as distinguished for the boldness of their views as for the freedom
with which they gave them utterance.</p>

<p>The main subject discussed by these men was the principle underlying
the Confucian system; namely, that man's nature is in its
origin perfectly good, and that so long as each one remains uncontaminated
by the world and the things of the world, the path of
virtue is to him the path of least resistance. While therefore a man
is able to remain unenticed by the temptations which necessarily
surround him, he advances in spotless purity towards perfection,
until virtue becomes in him so confirmed a habit that neither the
stings of conscience nor the exertion of intellectual effort is required
to maintain him in his position of perfect goodness and of
perfect peace.</p>

<p>These are still the opinions of orthodox Confucianists, but at different
times scholars have arisen, who from their own experiences in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3637]</span>
the world, have come to conclusions diametrically opposed to those
taught by the Sage. In their opinion the Psalmist was right when
he said, "The heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately
wicked." Scarcely had Confucius been gathered to his fathers
when the Philosopher Hs&uuml;n enunciated this view, and since then the
doctrine has formed the chief ground of contention among all schools
of philosophy down to the present day. By certain writers it has
been held that in man's nature there is a mixture of good and evil,
and by no one was this view more ably expounded than by the
philosopher Chu Hi (A.D. 1130-1200). In season and out of season
this great writer, who has done more than any one else to elucidate
the dark pages of the classics, "taught that good and evil were present
in the heart of every man, and that just as in nature a duality
of powers is necessary to the existence of nature itself, so good and
evil are inseparably present in the heart of every human being."</p>

<p>But there were others who felt that the bald and conventional
system proclaimed by Confucius was insufficient to satisfy the desire
for the supernatural which is implanted in men of every race and of
every clime, and then at once a school arose, headed by Laotz&#365; (sixth
century B.C.), the Old Philosopher; which, adopting the spirit of
Brahminism, taught its sectaries to seek by self-abnegation freedom
from the entanglements of the world, and a final absorption into the
Deity. The minds of most Chinamen are not attuned to the apprehension
of philosophical subtleties, and the wisdom imparted by
Laotz&#365; to his countrymen in the pages of his 'Taot&ecirc; King' (The
Book of Reason and Virtue), soon became debased into a superstitious
system by a succession of charlatans, who, adopting Laotz&#365;'s
doctrine that death was only another form of life, taught their followers
to seek to prolong the pleasures of the present state of existence
by searching in the mazes of alchemy for the elixir of life
and the philosopher's stone. Before the faith reached this degraded
position, however, several writers supplemented and enlarged on the
doctrines advanced by Laotz&#365;. Foremost among these were Litz&#365;
and Chwangtz&#365;, who were both men of great metaphysical ability,
and whose speculations, though not always in harmony with those of
their great master, help to some extent to elucidate his system and
certainly add considerable interest to it.</p>

<p>Around the systems of Confucius and Laotz&#365; a considerable literature
grew up, which was cherished, copied, and discussed by all
those scholars who had time to spare from the contemplation of the
records of the various States into which the country was divided.
These records had assumed a permanent place in the literature of
the land, and were bound up with the feudal system which then
existed. The time came, however, when this feudal system was<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3638]</span>
destined to come to an end. In the third century before Christ a
leader arose who proclaimed the States an Empire and himself as
Emperor. To so conservatively minded a people as the Chinese the
revolution was difficult of acceptance, and Shi Hwangti, seeking to
facilitate the transfer of their allegiance, ordered the destruction of
all books which might preserve the memory of a bygone constitution.
With ruthless severity the ukase was put into force, and all works,
with the exception of those on medicine and alchemy, were thrown
to the flames. Happily no tyrant, however powerful, can enforce the
complete fulfillment of such an edict; and in spite of threats and
persecutions, events showed that through all that fiery time manuscripts
had been carefully preserved, and that men had been found
ready to risk their lives in the sacred cause of learning.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Dynasty founded by Shi Hwangti was short-lived,
and in 202 B.C. a revolution placed Kao ti, the founder of the
Han Dynasty, on the throne. With commendable wisdom Kao ti
placed himself at once in complete harmony with the national mind,
and had no sooner assumed the imperial yellow than he notified his
desire to restore the national literature to its former status. Under
his fostering care, manuscripts which had lain hidden were brought
out from their places of concealment; and to these works were
added others, which were dictated by scholars who had treasured
them in their memories. That the works thus again brought out
were numerous, is proved by the fact that in the catalogue of the
Imperial Library of the Han Dynasty (B.C. 202 to A.D. 25), mention
is made of 11,312 works, consisting of volumes on the classics, philosophy,
poetry, military tactics, mathematics and medicine.</p>

<p>It was during this dynasty that the national history and poetry
took their rise in the shapes with which we are now familiar. After
the night of turmoil and darkness which had just passed away,
men, as though invigorated by the time of sterility, devoted themselves
to the production of cultured prose and original though
pedantic poetry. It was then that Ss&#365;ma Ch'ien, who has been
called the Herodotus of China, wrote his 'Shichi' (Historical Records),
which embraces a period of between two and three thousand
years; namely, from the reign of Hwang ti (B.C. 2697) to the reign
of Wu ti of the Han Dynasty (B.C. 140-86). Following the example
of this great chronicler, Pan ku compiled the records of the Han
Dynasty in a hundred and twenty books, and it is on the model thus
laid down that all succeeding dynastic histories of China have been
written. Almost without variation the materials of these vast depositories
of information are arranged in the following order:&mdash;1. Imperial
records, consisting of the purely political events which occurred
in each reign. 2. Memoirs, including treatises on mathematical chro<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3639]</span>nology,
rites, music, jurisprudence, political economy, State sacrifices,
astronomy, elemental influences, geography, literature, biographies,
and records of the neighboring countries.</p>

<p><i>Tempora non animi mutant</i>, and in the poetry of this period we
see a close resemblance to the spirit which breathes in the odes collected
by Confucius. The measure shows signs of some elasticity,
five characters to a line taking the place of the older four-syllabled
metre; but the ideas which permeate it are the same. Like all
Chinese poetry, it is rather quaint than powerful, and is rather
noticeable for romantic sweetness than for the expression of strong
passions. There is for the most part a somewhat melancholy ring
about it. The authors love to lament their absence from home or
the oppressed condition of the people, or to enlarge on the depressing
effect of rain or snow, and find sadness in the strange beauty of
the surrounding scenery or the loveliness of a flower. The diction is
smooth and the fancy wandering, but its lines do not much stir the
imagination or arouse the passions. These are criticisms which apply
to Chinese poetry of all ages. During the T'ang and Sung Dynasties
(A.D. 618-1127), periods which have been described as forming the
Augustan ages of Chinese literature, poets flourished abundantly, and
for the better expression of their ideas they adopted a metre of
seven characters or syllables, instead of the earlier and more restricted
measures. Tu Fu, Li T'aipai, and a host of others, enriched
the national poetry at the time, and varied the subjects which had
been the common themes of earlier poets by singing the praises of
wine. To be a poet it was considered necessary by them that a
man should be a wine-bibber, and their verses describe with enthusiasm
the pleasures of the cup and the joys of intoxication. The
following is a specimen of such an ode, taken from the works of Li
T'aipai:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If life be nothing but an empty dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why vex one's self about the things of time?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sleep away the fumes of drowsy wine.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sad and disturbed, I heave a gentle sigh,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3640]</span></p>
<p>But before the time of the T'ang Dynasty a new element had
been introduced into the national literature. With the introduction
of Buddhism the Chinese became acquainted with religious doctrines
and philosophical ideas, of which until then they had only been
faintly conscious from their contact with the debased form of Brahminical
teaching which under the name of Taoism had long existed
in the land. A complete knowledge of the teachings of Sakyamuni
was however imparted to them by the arrival, at the beginning of
the first century of our era, of two Shamans from India who settled
at Loyang in the province of Honan, and who translated the Sanskrit
Sutra in forty-two sections into Chinese. From this time onward
a constant succession of Buddhist missionaries visited China and
labored with indefatigable industry, both by oral teaching and by the
translation of Sanskrit works into Chinese, to convert the people to
their faith.</p>

<p>The knowledge thus acquired was of great advantage to the literature
of the country. It enriched it with new ideas, and added wider
knowledge to its pages. The history and geography of India, with
which scholars had previously been scarcely acquainted, became,
though indistinctly, matters of knowledge to them. Already Fahsien,
the great forerunner of Chinese Buddhist pilgrims (B.C. 399), had
visited India and had described in his 'Fuh kwo chi' (The Records
of Buddhist Countries) the wonders which he had seen in Hindustan.
With the spread of Buddhism in China, a desire to follow in his
footsteps prompted others to undertake the long and arduous journey
across the Mongolian steppes and over the passes of the Himalayas
into the plains of India. Sung yun in the sixth century and H&uuml;an
Ts'ang in the seventh are conspicuous among those who undertook
this toilsome pilgrimage in the interest of the faith.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the occasional influx of new sentiments, however,
the circumscribed circle of knowledge which was within the reach of
Chinese scholars, and the poverty of their vocabulary, have always
necessarily limited the wealth of their ideas; and at an early period
of the history of the country we see symptoms of sterility creeping
over the national mind. It is always easier to remember than to
think; and it cannot but be looked upon as a sign of decadence in a
literature when collections of ready-made knowledge take the place
of original compositions, and when scholars devote themselves to the
production of anthologies and encyclop&aelig;dias instead of seeking out
new thoughts and fresh branches of learning. In the sixth century,
a period which coincides with the invention of printing, there was
first shown that disposition to collect extracts from works of merit
into anthologies, which have ever since been such a marked peculiarity
of Chinese literature.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3641]</span></p>
<p>That the effect of these works, and of the encyclop&aelig;dias which
are in a sense allied to them, has been detrimental to the national
mind, there cannot be a doubt. Scholars are no longer required to
search for themselves for the golden nuggets of knowledge in the
mines of learning. They have but to turn to the great depositories
of carefully extracted information, and they find ready to their hand
the opinions and thoughts of all those who are considered to be
authorities on the subject with which they desire to acquaint themselves.
For the purposes of cram for students at the competitive
examinations, these treasuries of knowledge are of inestimable value:
and by their help, "scholars" who have neither depth of knowledge
nor power of thought are able to make a show of erudition which is
as hollow as it is valueless.</p>

<p>During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) this class of literature may
be said to have reached its highest development. In the reign
of the Emperor Yunglo (1403-1425) was compiled the largest encyclop&aelig;dia
which has ever seen the light. This gigantic work, which was
entitled 'Yunglo ta tien,' consisted of no fewer than 22,877 books,
and covered every branch of knowledge possessed by the Chinese.
Possibly owing to its immense extent, it was never published; and
such volumes as still survive the destroying influences of neglect and
decay are yet to be found in manuscript on the shelves of the Imperial
Library. Inspired perhaps by the example thus set, the Emperor
K'anghi of the present dynasty appointed a commission of scholars
to compile a similar work; and after forty years had been consumed
in extracting from the past literatures every passage bearing on the
6109 headings which it was the will of K'anghi should be illustrated,
the compilers were able to lay before their sovereign a work consisting
of 5020 volumes, which they entitled 'Kin L'ing ku kin t'u shu
chi ch'&ecirc;ng.' Unlike Yunglo's great work, this one was printed; and
though only, as it is said, a hundred copies were issued, some still
remain of the original edition. One such copy, complete in every
particular, is to be seen at the British Museum. For completeness
from a Chinese point of view this work stands out pre-eminently
above all others; but owing to the very limited number of copies, it
has never superseded the 'W&ecirc;n hsien t'ung k'ao' by Ma Twanlin,
which, though published four hundred years earlier, still holds its
own in popular estimation.</p>

<p>Much has been written by Chinese authors on scientific subjects,
but the substance is remarkable for its extent rather than for
its value. In each branch of knowledge they have advanced under
foreign influence up to a certain point, and beyond that they have
been unable to go. Their knowledge of astronomy, which is of Chaldean
origin, is sufficient to enable them to calculate eclipses and to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3642]</span>
recognize the precession of the equinoxes, but it has left them with
confused notions on subjects which are matters of common knowledge
among Western people. It is the same in the case of medicine.
They understand certain general principles of therapeutics
and the use of certain herbs; but their knowledge is purely empirical,
and their acquaintance with surgery is of the most elementary
kind.</p>

<p>It is perhaps in their novels and plays, however, that the most
marked defects in the national mind become apparent. The systems
of education and the consequent mental habit in vogue are the
outcomes of that lack of imagination which distinguishes the people,
and which finds its reflection in all those branches of literature
which are more directly dependent on the flow of new and striking
ideas. There is little delineation of character either in their novels
or their plays. The personages portrayed are all either models of
virtue and learning, or shocking examples of ignorance and turpitude.
Their actions are mechanical, and the incidents described
have little or no connection with one another. The stories are in
fact arranged much as a clever child might be expected to arrange
them, and they are by no means free from the weary iterations in
which untutored minds are apt to indulge. Chinese scholars are
conscious of these defects, and attempt to explain them by describing
novel-writing as being beneath the serious attention of all those
who are interested in learning. This view is commonly accepted by
their learned world, who divide literature into four classes, viz.,
Classics, History, Philosophy, and Belles-lettres. The last of these
does not include either romances or plays; and with the exception
of two or three standard works of fiction and the 'Hundred Plays of
the Y&uuml;an Dynasty' (A.D. 1280-1368), no specimens of either of these
two classes of literature would ever be found in a library of standing.
But this contempt for works of imagination is probably less
the cause of their inferiority than the result of it. The Providence
which has given Chinamen untiring diligence, inexhaustible memories,
and a love of learning, has not vouchsafed to touch their
tongues with the live coal of imagination. They are plodding students,
and though quite capable of narrating events and of producing
endless dissertations on the interpretation of the classics and the
true meaning of the philosophy on which they are based, are entirely
unprovided with that power of fancy which is able to bring
before the eye, as in a living picture, the phantoms of the brain.</p>

<p>Men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial

<h2><a name="RUFUS_CHOATE" id="RUFUS_CHOATE"></a>RUFUS CHOATE</h2>

<h4>(1799-1859)</h4>

<h4>BY ALBERT STICKNEY</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capr.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="R" title="R" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ufus Choate, one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of
advocates who have appeared at the English or American
bar, was one of the most remarkable products of what is
ordinarily considered hard, prosaic, matter-of-fact New England. He
was a man quite apart from the ordinary race of lawyers or New-Englanders.
He was as different from the typical New-Englander as
was Hawthorne or Emerson. He had the imagination of a poet; and
to his imagination, singular as it may seem,
was largely due his success in handling questions
of fact before juries.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">
<img src="images/choate.jpg" width="168" height="196" alt="Rufus Choate" title="Rufus Choate" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Rufus Choate</span></span>
</div>

<p>He was born of good old English stock,
in the southeastern part of the town of
Ipswich, in the county of Essex and State
of Massachusetts, on the first day of October,
1799. His ancestors had lived in Essex
County from a very early date in its history
and had filled important public positions.
He was born and bred in sight of the sea,
and his love for it stayed with him through
life. One of his most eloquent addresses
was on 'The Romance of the Sea.'  And in
his last illness at Halifax, his keenest pleasure
was to watch the ships sailing in front of his windows. Dropping
into sleep on one occasion, a few days before his death, he
said to his attendant, "If a schooner or sloop goes by, don't disturb
me; but if there is a square-rigged vessel, wake me."</p>

<p>Mr. Choate had the ordinary education then given in New England
to young men who had a love of learning. He began with the
district school; from there he went to the academy at Hampton,
New Hampshire; and later he entered Dartmouth College, where he
graduated the first scholar in his class, in 1819. It is hard to find
an accurate standard of comparison between the scholarship of that
period and that of the present. No doubt, in our New England
colleges of to-day there is a larger number of young men who have
a considerable store of knowledge on many subjects of classical
learning. But it is very doubtful if the graduates of Harvard and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3650]</span>
Yale of to-day are able to read the standard classic authors at the
day of their graduation, with the ease and accuracy of Mr. Choate
at the end of his active professional career in the year 1859. His
continued devotion to the classics is shown by the following extract
from his journal in the year 1844, while he was a member of
Congress:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. Some professional work must be done every day.... Recent
experiences suggest that I ought to be more familiar with evidence and
Cowen's Phillips; therefore, daily for half an hour, I will thumb conscientiously.
When I come home again, in the intervals of actual employment, my
recent methods of reading, accompanying the reports with the composition of
arguments upon the points adjudged, may be properly resumed.</p>

<p>"2. In my Greek, Latin, and French readings&mdash;Odyssey, Thucydides,
Tacitus, Juvenal, and some French orator or critic&mdash;I need make no change.
So, too, Milton, Johnson, Burke&mdash;<i>semper in manu&mdash;ut mos est.</i> To my
Greek I ought to add a page a day of Crosby's Grammar, and the practice of
parsing every word in my few lines of Homer. On Sunday, the Greek Testament,
and Septuagint, and French. This, and the oration of the Crown,
which I will completely master, translate, annotate, and commit, will be
enough in this kind. If not, I will add a translation of a sentence or two
from Tacitus."</p>

<p>A similar extract from his journal under the date of December
15th, 1844, reads:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I begin a great work,&mdash;Thucydides, in Bloomfield's new edition,&mdash;with
the intention of understanding a difficult and learning something from an
instructive writer,&mdash;something for the more and more complicated, interior,
<i>inter-State</i> American politics.</p>

<p>"With Thucydides, I shall read Wachsmuth, with historical references and
verifications. Schomann on the Assemblies of the Athenians, especially, I am
to meditate, and master Danier's Horace, Ode 1, 11th to 14th line, translation
and notes,&mdash;a pocket edition to be always in pocket."</p>

<p>Throughout his life Mr. Choate kept up his classical studies. Few
of the graduates of our leading colleges to-day carry from Commencement
a training which makes the study of the Greek and Latin
authors either easy or pleasant. Mr. Choate, like nearly every lawyer
who has ever distinguished himself at the English bar, was a
monument to the value of the study of the classics as a mere means
of training for the active practical work of a lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Choate studied law at Cambridge in the Harvard Law School.
Nearly a year he spent at Washington in the office of Mr. Wirt, then
Attorney-General of the United States. This was in 1821. Thereafter
he was admitted to the bar, in September, 1823. He opened his
office in Salem, but soon removed to Danvers, where he practiced for
four or five years.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3651]</span></p>
<p>During these earliest years of his professional life he had the
fortune which many other brilliant men in his profession have experienced,&mdash;that
of waiting and hoping. During his first two or three
years, it is said, he was so despondent as to his chances of professional
success that he seriously contemplated abandoning the law. In
time he got his opportunity to show the stuff of which he was made.
His first professional efforts were in petty cases before justices of
the peace. Very soon however his great ability, with his untiring
industry and his intense devotion to any cause in his hands, brought
the reputation which he deserved, and reputation brought clients.</p>

<p>In 1828 he removed to Salem. The Essex bar was one of great
ability. Mr. Choate at once became a leader. Among his contemporaries
at that bar was Caleb Cushing. Mr. Choate at first had
many criminal cases. In the year 1830 he was, with Mr. Webster,
one of the counsel for the prosecution in the celebrated White murder
case.</p>

<p>In 1830 he was elected to Congress as a member of the House of
Representatives, at the age of thirty-one years. At once he laid out
a course of study which was to fit him for the duties of his public
life. An extract from it reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="author">"Nov. 4, 1830.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Facienda ad munus nuper impositum</i>.</p>

<p>"i. Pers. quals. [personal qualities], Memory, Daily Food, and Cowper
<i>dum ambulo</i>. Voice, Manner, <i>Exercitationes diurn&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>"2. Current politics in papers. 1. <i>Cum Notulis</i>, daily,&mdash;Geog., &amp;c. 2.
Annual Reg., Past Intelligencers, &amp;c.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"4. Civil History of U. States&mdash;in Pitkin and original sources.</p>

<p>"5. Exam. of Pending Questions: Tariff, Pub. Lands, Indians, Nullifications.</p>

<p>"6. Am. and Brit. Eloquence,&mdash;Writing, Practice."</p>
</div>

<p>Then follow in his manuscript upwards of twenty pages of close
writing, consisting of memoranda and statements, drawn from a multitude
of sources, on the subjects laid down by him at the beginning
as the ones to be investigated.</p>

<p>In Congress he found himself in competition with many men of
marked ability. Among the members of Congress then from Massachusetts
were Mr. Webster in the Senate; and in the House, John
Quincy Adams, Edward Everett, Nathan Appleton, George N. Briggs,
and John Davis. In the Senate, from other States, were Peleg
Sprague from Maine,&mdash;one of the ablest jurists this country has produced;
Samuel Prentiss, Mr. Marcy, Mr. Dallas, Mr. Clayton, Mr.
Clay, and Mr. Benton. In the House were James M. Wayne, Mr.
McDuffie, Mr. Polk, Mr. Corwin, and Mr. Verplanck.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3652]</span></p>
<p>Among men of this calibre Mr. Choate at once, with ease, took
rank as one of the first. He made but two speeches during the
session; but these gave him a position which he ever afterwards held
among the most eloquent and convincing speakers in public life.</p>

<p>In April 1833 Mr. Choate was re-elected to Congress. At this
session he made a speech on the removal of the public deposits by
President Jackson from the Bank of the United States. The following
incident shows his power as an orator:&mdash;</p>

<p>Benjamin Hardin was then a member from Kentucky, of the
House of Representatives; and was himself intending to speak on
the same side of the question with Mr. Choate. In such cases, Mr.
Hardin's rule was to listen to no other speaker before speaking himself.
Consequently when Mr. Choate began speaking, Mr. Hardin
started to leave the House.  He waited however for a moment to
listen to a few sentences from Mr. Choate, and with this result, as
told in his own words:&mdash;"The member from Massachusetts rose to
speak, and in accordance with my custom I took my hat to leave,
lingering a moment just to notice the tone of his voice and the
manner of his speech. But that moment was fatal to my resolution.
I became charmed by the music of his voice, and was captivated by
the power of his eloquence, and found myself wholly unable to
move until the last word of his beautiful speech had been uttered."</p>

<p>At the close of this session Mr. Choate resigned his seat in Congress
and went to Boston, there to follow the practice of his profession.
At the Boston bar he met a remarkably brilliant group of
men.  There were Jeremiah Mason, whom Mr. Webster is said to
have considered the strongest man that he ever met in any legal
contest; Franklin Dexter; Chief Justice Shaw (then at the bar); Judges
Wilde, Hoar, and Thomas, afterwards of the Massachusetts Supreme
Court; Mr. Fletcher, Judge Benjamin R. Curtis, Sidney Bartlett,
Richard H. Dana, William D. Sohier, Henry W. Paine, Edward D.
Sohier, with others whose names are now almost forgotten.  These
men formed a bar the like of which has seldom if ever been assembled
in any one jurisdiction.  Here too Mr. Choate at once came to
the front. With every talent which could make a man a great advocate,&mdash;with
a marvelous memory, a keen logical intellect, a sound
legal judgment,&mdash;he had now acquired a large professional experience
and a very complete professional training. As has been seen, he had
a thorough classical training,&mdash;that is, of the kind best fitted to his
needs.  His professional studies before beginning his professional
practice had been the best then attainable; very possibly, for him,
they were quite as good as can be had at any of the law schools of
to-day.  His range of reading and information was extremely wide.
He had had several years of experience at Washington in Congress.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3653]</span>And ever since leaving the law school his mere professional studies
had been most severe. It is hard to see how any man could be
better equipped for professional practice than Mr. Choate was at this
time.</p>

<p>His success at the Boston bar was phenomenal. He was in a contest
with giants. Mr. Webster alone could be deemed to dispute
with Mr. Choate the place of supremacy. The general verdict has
been that for pure intellectual power Mr. Webster was the superior.
But it may well be doubted whether as an all-round advocate Mr.
Choate did not carry off the palm. The common idea of Mr. Choate
has been that his marvelous eloquence was his great source of
strength and success in his forensic contests. This is an error.
Eloquent he undoubtedly was; few men have ever been more so.
But unless in frontier communities, eloquence alone has never commanded
great success at the bar&mdash;if indeed it has ever existed&mdash;without
strong logical power and sound judgment. The power of
convincing intelligent men always depends largely and mainly on
soundness of judgment in the selection of positions. Especially is this
so in the profession of the law. There have been, no doubt, many
instances where men of eloquence have captivated juries by appeals
to passion or prejudice. But in the vast majority of cases, success
as an advocate cannot be had without sound judgment in the selection
of positions, coupled with the power of clear logical statement.
Mr. Choate was no exception to this rule. Mr. Henry W. Paine, one
of the leaders of the Boston bar in Mr. Choate's time,&mdash;himself one
of the most logical of men,&mdash;once said that he did not care to hear
Mr. Choate address a jury, but to hear him argue a bill of exceptions
before the full bench of the Supreme Court was one of the greatest
intellectual treats. With the ordinary twelve men in a jury-box Mr.
Choate was a wizard. His knowledge of human nature, his wide and
deep sympathies, his imagination, his power of statement, with his
rich musical voice and his wonderful fascination of manner, made
him a charmer of men and a master in the great art of winning
verdicts. So far as the writer is able to form an opinion, there has
never been at the English or American bar a man who has been his
equal in his sway over juries. Comparisons are often condemned, but
they are at times useful. Comparing Mr. Choate with Mr. Webster,
it must be conceded that Mr. Webster might at times carry a jury
against Mr. Choate by his force of intellect and the tremendous
power of his personal presence. Mr. O'Conor once said that he did
not consider Mr. Webster an eloquent man. "Mr. Webster," he said,
"was an intellectual giant. But he never impressed me as being an
eloquent man." The general judgment is that Mr. Webster had
eloquence of a very high order. But Mr. Choate was a magician.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3654]</span>
With any opponent of his time except Mr. Webster, he was irresistible
before juries. Mr. Justice Catron of the United States Court is
reported to have said of Mr. Choate, "I have heard the most eminent
advocates, but he surpasses them all." His success came from a
rare combination of eloquence, sound logical judgment, and great
powers of personal fascination.</p>

<p>In another respect the common opinion of Mr. Choate must be
corrected. His great powers of persuasion and conviction undoubtedly
gave him some victories which were not deserved by the mere merits
of his cases. From this fact there went abroad the impression that
he was a man without principle, and that his ethical standards were
not high in his selection and conduct of cases. This impression is
quite contrary to the judgment of the competent. The impression
was due largely to his success in the celebrated defense of Tirrell.
Tirrell was indicted for the murder of a woman named Bickford, with
whom Tirrell had long associated, who was found dead in a house of
ill-repute. At about the hour when the woman lost her life, either
by her own hand or by that of Tirrell, the house caught fire. The
cause of the fire was not proved. Tirrell had been in her company
the preceding evening, and articles of clothing belonging to him
were found in the morning in her room. Many circumstances seemed
to indicate that the woman had been killed by Tirrell. He was also
indicted for arson in setting fire to the house. In addition to other
facts proved by the defense, it was shown by reputable witnesses
that Tirrell had from his youth been subject to somnambulism; and
one of the positions taken by Mr. Choate for the defense was that
the killing, if done by Tirrell at all, was done by him while unconscious,
in a condition of somnambulism. Tirrell was tried under
both indictments and was acquitted on both. The indictment for
murder was tried before Justices Wilde, Dewey, and Hubbard. The
indictment for arson was tried before Chief Justice Shaw and Justices
Wilde and Dewey. The foreman of the jury stated that the defense
of somnambulism received no weight in the deliberations of the jury.
The judgment of the profession has been that the verdicts were the
only ones which could properly have been rendered on the evidence.
In the arson case the charge to the jury was by Chief Justice Shaw,
and was strongly in favor of the defense. No doubt the defense was
extremely able and ingenious. But the criticisms against Mr. Choate
for his conduct of those cases, in the opinion of those members of
the profession best qualified to judge, have been held to be without
good foundation. Lawyers&mdash;that is, reputable ones&mdash;do not manufacture
evidence, nor are they the witnesses who testify to facts.
The severe tests of cross-examination usually elicit the truth. No
one ever charged Mr. Choate with manufacturing evidence. And no
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3655]</span>lawyer of good judgment, so far as the writer is aware, has ever
charged him with practices which were not in keeping with the very
highest professional standards.</p>

<p>In the space here allotted, any attempt to give an adequate idea
of Mr. Choate's professional and public work is quite out of the
question. In addition to the conduct of an unusually large professional
practice he did a large amount of literary work, mainly in the
delivery of lectures, which at that time in New England were almost
a part of the public system of education. Throughout his life he
took an active part in politics. He attended the Whig convention at
Baltimore in 1852, where General Scott received his nomination for
the Presidency, and where Mr. Choate made one of the most eloquent
speeches of his life in his effort to secure the nomination for
Mr. Webster.</p>

<p>Mr. Choate finally killed himself by overwork. Though a man of
great physical strength and remarkable vitality, no constitution could
stand the strain of his intense labors in the different lines of law,
literature, and politics. His magnificent physique finally broke down.
He died on July 13th, 1859, being not quite sixty years. His death
was an important public event. In the public press, at many public
meetings throughout the country, and by public men of the highest
distinction, his death was treated as a public misfortune. In his day
he rendered distinguished public services. He had the capacities
and the interests which fitted him to be a great statesman. Had
it not been for our system of short terms, and rotation in office,
Mr. Choate would probably have remained in public life from the
time of his entry into Congress, would have been a most valuable
public servant, and would have left a great reputation as a statesman.
As it was, he left, so far as now appears, only the ephemeral
reputation of a great advocate.</p>

<p>This scanty sketch can best be closed by a quotation from the
address of Richard H. Dana at the meeting of the Boston bar held
just after Mr. Choate's death. That extract will show the judgment
of Mr. Choate which was held by the giants among whom he lived
and of whom he was the leader:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The wine of life is drawn.' 'The golden bowl is broken.' The age of
miracles has passed. The day of inspiration is over. The Great Conqueror,
unseen and irresistible, has broken into our temple and has carried off the
vessels of gold, the vessels of silver, the precious stones, the jewels, and the
ivory; and like the priests of the temple of Jerusalem after the invasion from
Babylon, we must content ourselves as we can with vessels of wood and of
stone and of iron.</p>

<p>"With such broken phrases as these, Mr. Chairman, perhaps not altogether
just to the living, we endeavor to express the emotions natural to this hour of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3656]</span>
our bereavement. Talent, industry, eloquence, and learning, there are still,
and always will be, at the bar of Boston. But if I say that the age of miracles
has passed, that the day of inspiration is over,&mdash;if I cannot realize that
in this place where we now are, the cloth of gold was spread, and a banquet
set fit for the gods,&mdash;I know, sir, you will excuse it. Any one who has lived
with him and now survives him, will excuse it;&mdash;any one who like the youth
in Wordsworth's Ode,&mdash;</p>

<p>It will also tend to secure justice to Mr. Choate's memory, if
there be here recorded the statement by Judge Benjamin R. Curtis
of the judgment of the men of Mr. Choate's own profession, as to the
moral standards by which Mr. Choate was governed in his practice.
Judge Curtis said in his address at the same meeting of the Boston
Bar:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I desire, therefore, on this occasion and in this presence, to declare our
appreciation of the injustice which would be done to this great and eloquent
advocate by attributing to him any want of loyalty to truth, or any deference
to wrong, because he employed all his great powers and attainments, and
used to the utmost his consummate skill and eloquence, in exhibiting and
enforcing the comparative merits of one side of the cases in which he acted.
<i>In doing so he but did his duty. If other people did theirs, the administration
of justice was secured.</i>"</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PURITAN_IN_SECULAR_AND_RELIGIOUS_LIFE" id="THE_PURITAN_IN_SECULAR_AND_RELIGIOUS_LIFE"></a>THE PURITAN IN SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS LIFE</h3>

<h4>From Address Delivered at the Ipswich Centennial, 1834</h4>

<p>Turn first now for a moment to the old English Puritans, the
fathers of our fathers, of whom came, of whom were, planters
of Ipswich, of Massachusetts, of New England,&mdash;of
whom came, of whom were, our own Ward, Parker, and Saltonstall,
and Wise, Norton, and Rogers, and Appleton, and Cobbet,
and Winthrop,&mdash;and see whether they were likely to be the
founders of a race of freemen or slaves. Remember then, the
true, noblest, the least questioned, least questionable, praise of
these men is this: that for a hundred years they were the sole
depositaries of the sacred fire of liberty in England after it had
gone out in every other bosom,&mdash;that they saved at its last
gasp the English Constitution,&mdash;which the Tudors and the first
two Stuarts were rapidly changing into just such a gloomy despotism
as they saw in France and Spain,&mdash;and wrought into it
every particle of freedom which it now possesses,&mdash;that when
they first took their seats in the House of Commons, in the
early part of the reign of Elizabeth, they found it the cringing
and ready tool of the throne, and that they reanimated it, remodeled
it, reasserted its privileges, restored it to its constitutional
rank, drew back to it the old power of making laws, redressing
wrongs, and imposing taxes, and thus again rebuilt and opened
what an Englishman called "the chosen temple of liberty," an
English House of Commons,&mdash;that they abridged the tremendous
power of the crown and defined it,&mdash;and when at last
Charles Stuart resorted to arms to restore the despotism they
had partially overthrown, that they met him on a hundred fields
of battle, and buried, after a sharp and long struggle, crown
and mitre and the headless trunk of the king himself beneath
the foundations of a civil and religious commonwealth. This
praise all the historians of England&mdash;Whig and Tory, Protestant
and Catholic, Hume, Hallam, Lingard, and all&mdash;award to
the Puritans. By what causes this spirit of liberty had been
breathed into the masculine, enthusiastic, austere, resolute character
of this extraordinary body of men, in such intensity as to
mark them off from all the rest of the people of England, I
cannot here and now particularly consider. It is a thrilling and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3658]</span>
awful history of the Puritans in England, from their first emerging
above the general level of Protestants, in the time of Henry
VIII. and Edward VI., until they were driven by hundreds and
thousands to these shores; but I must pass it over. It was just
when the nobler and grander traits&mdash;the enthusiasm and piety
and hardihood and energy&mdash;of Puritanism had attained the highest
point of exaltation to which, in England, it ever mounted up,
and the love of liberty had grown to be the great master-passion
that fired and guided all the rest,&mdash;it was just then that our
portion of its disciples, filled with the undiluted spirit, glowing
with the intensest fervors of Protestantism and republicanism
together, came hither, and in that elevated and holy and resolved
frame began to build the civil and religious structures
which you see around you.</p>

<p>Trace now their story a little farther onward through the
Colonial period to the War of Independence, to admire with me
the providential agreement of circumstances by which that spirit
of liberty which brought them hither was strengthened and reinforced;
until at length, instructed by wisdom, tempered by virtue,
and influenced by injuries, by anger and grief and conscious
worth and the sense of violated right, it burst forth here and
wrought the wonders of the Revolution. I have thought that if
one had the power to place a youthful and forming people like
the Northern colonists, in whom the love of freedom was already
vehement and healthful, in a situation the most propitious for
the growth and perfection of that sacred sentiment, he could
hardly select a fairer field for so interesting an experiment than
the actual condition of our fathers for the hundred and fifty
years after their arrival, to the War of the Revolution.</p>

<p>They had freedom enough to teach them its value and to
refresh and elevate their spirits, wearied, not despondent, from
the contentions and trials of England. They were just so far
short of perfect freedom that instead of reposing for a moment
in the mere fruition of what they had, they were kept emulous
and eager for more, looking all the while up and aspiring to rise
to a loftier height, to breathe a purer air, and bask in a brighter
beam. Compared with the condition of England down to 1688,&mdash;compared
with that of the larger part of the continent of
Europe down to our Revolution,&mdash;theirs was a privileged and
liberal condition. The necessaries of freedom, if I may say
so,&mdash;its plainer food and homelier garments and humbler habita<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3659]</span>tions,&mdash;were
theirs. Its luxuries and refinements, its festivals,
its lettered and social glory, its loftier port and prouder look and
richer graces, were the growth of a later day; these came in
with independence. Here was liberty enough to make them love
it for itself, and to fill them with those lofty and kindred sentiments
which are at once its fruit and its nutriment and safeguard
in the soul of man. But their liberty was still incomplete,
and it was constantly in danger from England; and these two
circumstances had a powerful effect in increasing that love and
confirming those sentiments. It was a condition precisely adapted
to keep liberty, as a subject of thought and feeling and desire,
every moment in mind. Every moment they were comparing
what they had possessed with what they wanted and had a right
to; they calculated by the rule of three, if a fractional part of
freedom came to so much, what would express the power and
value of the whole number! They were restive and impatient
and ill at ease; a galling wakefulness possessed their faculties
like a spell. Had they been wholly slaves, they had lain still
and slept. Had they been wholly free, that eager hope, that
fond desire, that longing after a great, distant, yet practicable
good, would have given way to the placidity and luxury and
carelessness of complete enjoyment; and that energy and wholesome
agitation of mind would have gone down like an ebb-tide.
As it was, the whole vast body of waters all over its surface,
down to its sunless, utmost depths, was heaved and shaken and
purified by a spirit that moved above it and through it and gave
it no rest, though the moon waned and the winds were in their
caves; they were like the disciples of the old and bitter philosophy
of paganism, who had been initiated into one stage of the
greater mysteries, and who had come to the door, closed, and
written over with strange characters, which led up to another.
They had tasted of truth, and they burned for a fuller draught;
a partial revelation of that which shall be hereafter had dawned;
and their hearts throbbed eager, yet not without apprehension,
to look upon the glories of the perfect day. Some of the mystery
of God, of Nature, of Man, of the Universe, had been
unfolded; might they by prayer, by abstinence, by virtue, by
retirement, by contemplation, entitle themselves to read another
page in the clasped and awful volume?</p>

<h3><a name="THE_NEW-ENGLANDERS_CHARACTER" id="THE_NEW-ENGLANDERS_CHARACTER"></a>THE NEW-ENGLANDER'S CHARACTER</h3>

<h4>From Address Delivered at the Ipswich Centennial, 1834</h4>

<p>I hold it to have been a great thing, in the first place, that we
had among us, at that awful moment when the public mind
was meditating the question of submission to the tea tax, or
resistance by arms, and at the more awful moment of the first
appeal to arms,&mdash;that we had some among us who personally
knew what war was. Washington, Putnam, Stark, Gates, Prescott,
Montgomery, were soldiers already. So were hundreds of
others of humbler rank, but not yet forgotten by the people whom
they helped to save, who mustered to the camp of our first
Revolutionary armies. These all had tasted a soldier's life.
They had seen fire, they had felt the thrilling sensations, the
quickened flow of blood to and from the heart, the mingled
apprehension and hope, the hot haste, the burning thirst, the
feverish rapture of battle, which he who has not felt is unconscious
of one-half of the capacities and energies of his nature;
which he who has felt, I am told, never forgets. They had slept
in the woods on the withered leaves or the snow, and awoke to
breakfast upon birch-bark and the tender tops of willow-trees.
They had kept guard on the outposts on many a stormy night,
knowing perfectly that the thicket half a pistol-shot off was full
of French and Indian riflemen.</p>

<p>I say it was something that we had such men among us.
They helped discipline our raw first levies. They knew what an
army is, and what it needs, and how to provide for it. They
could take that young volunteer of sixteen by the hand, sent by
an Ipswich mother, who after looking upon her son equipped
for battle from which he might not return, Spartan-like, bid him
go and behave like a man&mdash;and many, many such shouldered a
musket for Lexington and Bunker Hill&mdash;and assure him from
their own personal knowledge that after the first fire he never
would know fear again, even that of the last onset. But the
long and peculiar wars of New England had done more than to
furnish a few such officers and soldiers as these. They had
formed that public sentiment upon the subject of war which
re-united all the armies, fought all the battles, and won all the
glory of the Revolution. The truth is that war in some form or
another had been, from the first, one of the usages, one of the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3661]</span>
habits, of colonial life. It had been felt from the first to be
just as necessary as planting or reaping&mdash;to be as likely to
break out every day and every night as a thunder-shower in
summer, and to break out as suddenly. There have been
nations who boasted that their rivers or mountains never saw
the smoke of an enemy's camp. Here the war-whoop awoke
the sleep of the cradle; it startled the dying man on his pillow;
it summoned young and old from the meeting-house, from
the burial, and from the bridal ceremony, to the strife of death.
The consequence was that the steady, composed, and reflecting
courage which belongs to all the English race grew into a leading
characteristic of New England; and a public sentiment was
formed, pervading young and old and both sexes, which declared
it lawful, necessary, and honorable to risk life and to shed
blood for a great cause,&mdash;for our family, for our fires, for our
God, for our country, for our religion. In such a cause it
declared that the voice of God himself commanded to the field.
The courage of New England was the "courage of conscience."
It did not rise to that insane and awful passion, the love of
war for itself. It would not have hurried her sons to the Nile,
or the foot of the Pyramids, or across the great raging sea of
snows which rolled from Smolensko to Moscow, to set the stars
of glory upon the glowing brow of ambition. But it was a
courage which at Lexington, at Bunker Hill, at Bennington,
and at Saratoga, had power to brace the spirit for the patriot's
fight, and gloriously roll back the tide of menaced war from
their homes, the soil of their birth, the graves of their fathers,
and the everlasting hills of their freedom.</p>

<h3><a name="OF_THE_AMERICAN_BAR" id="OF_THE_AMERICAN_BAR"></a>OF THE AMERICAN BAR</h3>

<h4>From the Address before the Cambridge Law School, 1845</h4>

<p>Something such has, in all the past periods of our history, been
one of the functions of the American bar.  To vindicate
the true interpretation of the charters of the colonies, to
advise what forms of polity, what systems of jurisprudence,
what degree and what mode of liberty these charters permitted,&mdash;to
detect and expose that long succession of infringement
which grew at last to the Stamp Act and Tea Tax, and
compelled us to turn from broken charters to national independ<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3662]</span>ence,&mdash;to
conduct the transcendent controversy which preceded
the Revolution, that grand appeal to the reason of civilization,&mdash;this
was the work of our first generation of lawyers: to construct
the American constitutions: the higher praise of the
second generation. I claim it in part for the sobriety and learning
of the American bar; for the professional instinct towards
the past; for the professional appreciation of order, forms, obedience,
restraints; for the more than professional, the profound
and wide intimacy with the history of all liberty, classical,
medi&aelig;val, and above all, of English liberty,&mdash;I claim it in part
for the American bar that, springing into existence by revolution,&mdash;revolution,
which more than anything and all things
lacerates and discomposes the popular mind,&mdash;justifying that
revolution only on a strong principle of natural right, with not
one single element or agent of monarchy or aristocracy on our
soil or in our blood,&mdash;I claim it for the bar that the constitutions
of America so nobly closed the series of our victories!
These constitutions owe to the bar more than their terse and
exact expression and systematic arrangements: they owe to it
in part, too, their elements of permanence; their felicitous reconciliation
of universal and intense liberty with forms to enshrine
and regulations to restrain it; their Anglo-Saxon sobriety and
gravity conveyed in the genuine idiom, suggestive of the grandest
civil achievements of that unequaled race. To interpret
these constitutions, to administer and maintain them, this is the
office of our age of the profession.  Herein have we somewhat
wherein to glory; hereby we come into the class and share in
the dignity of founders of States, of restorers of States, of preservers
of States.</p>

<p>I said and I repeat that while lawyers, and because we are
lawyers, we are statesmen. We are by profession statesmen.
And who may measure the value of this department of public
duty? Doubtless in statesmanship there are many mansions,
and large variety of conspicuous service. Doubtless to have
wisely decided the question of war or peace,&mdash;to have adjusted
by a skillful negotiation a thousand miles of unsettled boundary-line,&mdash;to
have laid the corner-stone of some vast policy whereby
the currency is corrected, the finances enriched, the measure of
industrial fame filled,&mdash;are large achievements. And yet I do
not know that I can point to one achievement of this department
of American statesmanship which can take rank for its<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3663]</span>
consequences of good above that single decision of the Supreme
Court which adjudged that an act of legislature contrary to the
Constitution is void, and that the judicial department is clothed
with the power to ascertain the repugnancy and to pronounce
the legal conclusion. That the framers of the Constitution
intended this should be so is certain; but to have asserted it
against the Congress and the Executive,&mdash;to have vindicated it
by that easy yet adamantine demonstration than which the
reasonings of the mathematics show nothing surer,&mdash;to have
inscribed this vast truth of conservatism on the public mind, so
that no demagogue, not in the last stage of intoxication, denies
it,&mdash;this is an achievement of statesmanship of which a thousand
years may not exhaust or reveal all the good.</p>

<h4>From Eulogy delivered at Dartmouth College, 1853</h4>

<p>Sometimes it has seemed to me that to enable one to appreciate
with accuracy, as a psychological speculation, the
intrinsic and absolute volume and texture of that brain,&mdash;the
real rate and measure of those abilities,&mdash;it was better
not to see or hear him, unless you could see or hear him frequently,
and in various modes of exhibition; for undoubtedly
there was something in his countenance and bearing so expressive
of command,&mdash;something even in his conversational language
when saying "Parva summisse et modica temperate," so
exquisitely plausible, embodying the likeness at least of a rich
truth, the forms at least of a large generalization, in an epithet,&mdash;an
antithesis,&mdash;a pointed phrase,&mdash;a broad and peremptory
thesis,&mdash;and something in his grander forthputting, when roused
by a great subject or occasion exciting his reason and touching
his moral sentiments and his heart, so difficult to be resisted,
approaching so near, going so far beyond, the higher style of
man, that although it left you a very good witness of his power
of influencing others, you were not in the best condition immediately
to pronounce on the quality or the source of the influence.
You saw the flash and heard the peal, and felt the
admiration and fear; but from what region it was launched, and
by what divinity, and from what Olympian seat, you could not
certainly yet tell. To do that you must, if you saw him at all,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3664]</span>
see him many times; compare him with himself and with others;
follow his dazzling career from his father's house; observe from
what competitors he won those laurels; study his discourses,&mdash;study
them by the side of those of other great men of this country
and time, and of other countries and times, conspicuous in
the same fields of mental achievement,&mdash;look through the crystal
water of the style down to the golden sands of the thought;
analyze and contrast intellectual power somewhat; consider what
kind and what quantity of it has been held by students of mind
needful in order to great eminence in the higher mathematics,
or metaphysics, or reason of the law; what capacity to analyze,
through and through, to the primordial elements of the truths of
that science; yet what wisdom and sobriety, in order to control
the wantonness and shun the absurdities of a mere scholastic
logic, by systematizing ideas, and combining them, and repressing
one by another, thus producing, not a collection of intense
and conflicting paradoxes, but <i>a code</i>, scientifically coherent
and practically useful,&mdash;consider what description and what
quantity of mind have been held needful by students of mind in
order to conspicuous eminence&mdash;long maintained&mdash;in statesmanship;
that great practical science, that great philosophical art,
whose ends are the existence, happiness, and honor of a nation;
whose truths are to be drawn from the widest survey of man,&mdash;of
social man,&mdash;of the particular race and particular community
for which a government is to be made or kept, or a policy to be
provided; "philosophy in action," demanding at once or affording
place for the highest speculative genius and the most skillful
conduct of men and of affairs; and finally consider what degree
and kind of mental power has been found to be required in
order to influence the reason of an audience and a nation by
speech,&mdash;not magnetizing the mere nervous or emotional nature
by an effort of that nature, but operating on reason by reason&mdash;a
great reputation in forensic and deliberative eloquence,
maintained and advancing for a lifetime,&mdash;it is thus that we
come to be sure that his intellectual power was as real and as
uniform as its very happiest particular display had been imposing
and remarkable.</p>

<h2><a name="ST_JOHN_CHRYSOSTOM" id="ST_JOHN_CHRYSOSTOM"></a>ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM</h2>

<h4>(A.D. 347-407)</h4>

<h4>BY JOHN MALONE</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capa.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">&nbsp;strong soldier of the Cross and from good fighting stock
was that John of Antioch who, among the people that were
first of the earth to bear the name of Christian, was called
Chrysostom&mdash;"mouth of gold." His father Secundus, who died about
the time of Chrysostom's birth, was a military commander in Syria
under Constantine and Constantius II. John was born at Antioch,
A.D. 347, when the Eastern Empire and the City of Constantine
were new. His young mother Arethusa, a Christian, then but twenty
years of age, devoted herself to widowhood and the education of her
son in the city of his birth. The youth's early years were passed
under her careful guidance, and at the age of twenty he entered on
the study of oratory and philosophy under the celebrated Libanius.
In 369 he became a baptized Christian and reader in the house of
Melitius the bishop. The unhappy reigns of Valens and Valentinian,
when neo-paganism in the West and in the Gothic settlement in
the East began to work the Empire's fall, saw John devoted to an
ascetic life, after the example of the monks and hermits who sheltered
in the mountains about the gay and queenly city of his birth.
His mother's grief and loneliness brought him back from his cave to
an energetic career as an outspoken preacher of God's Word and the
eternal profit of good stout-hearted workaday well-doing. He made
himself dear to the people of Antioch, for he had eloquence such as
had been unknown to Greeks since Demosthenes, and he shrank not
from labor and self-denial. So they called him "golden-mouth," as
the Indians call their tried men "straight-tongues." On the death
of Nectarius, the successor of Gregory of Nazianzenus, Theophilus of
Alexandria and Arcadius the Emperor made him Metropolitan of Constantinople,
A.D. 397. All before this time he was laying about him
with good ear-smiting Greek at vice and luxury, of which there
was abundance both in palace and in hovel; and his elevation to an
Imperial neighborhood did not stay him. He cleared Byzantium of
pagan shows, gathered the relics of the martyrs, and sent missionaries
to preach to the Goths in their own speech. Not many years
of this kind of leadership were allowed him. Arcadius, well disposed
but indolent, was under the rule of a willful woman; and when
Chrysostom turned his swayful voice against her pet vanities, the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3666]</span>
vexed Eudoxia intrigued his deposition. In 403 John went to exile
in Bithynia, with the words "The Lord hath given, the Lord hath
taken away" upon his lips. A great earthquake so frightened the
Imperial City and family that with one outcry they called Chrysostom
back. When the fear of the infirm earth had worn away, Eudoxia
remembered her enmity and took it back to nurse. So one day
when John had said in his sword-like invective that "Herodias was
raging again," she showed less mercy than the Baptist had obtained;
for under the plea that his restoration had been unwarranted, the
Metropolitan was sent to a forced wandering in the wilds of outer
provinces, from which there returned of him only the venerated relics
of a martyr. Driven from spot to spot, sometimes in chains, always
under the prod of guarding spears, one day of September, 407, he
dragged himself to the tomb of the martyr Basiliscus at Comana in
Pontus, and laid his soul in the hands of God. Thirty years afterward,
Theodosius the Younger brought the body back to Constantinople.</p>

<p>In person Chrysostom was small and spare. His life of rigorous
fasting and toil made him still more slight and hollow-cheeked, but
it is told that there was always a blaze of fire in the deep-set eyes.
The work of Chrysostom was chiefly ecclesiastical oratory, in which
no one of his own or later time surpassed him. First of the great
Christian preachers after the Church came from the caves, he was
not less able as a teacher. His letters, full of sweetness and firm
honesty, his poetry, delicate and musical, and his philosophic essays,
rich with the clear-cut jewels of dialectics, are worthy of his station
in the first order of the Doctors of the Church.</p>

<h3><a name="THAT_REAL_WEALTH_IS_FROM_WITHIN" id="THAT_REAL_WEALTH_IS_FROM_WITHIN"></a>THAT REAL WEALTH IS FROM WITHIN</h3>

<h4>From the 'Treatise to prove that no one can harm the man who does not
injure himself'</h4>

<p>What I undertake is to prove (only make no commotion)
that no one of those who are wronged is wronged by
another, but experiences this injury at his own hands.</p>

<p>But in order to make my argument plainer, let us first of all
inquire what injustice is, and of what kind of things the material
of it is wont to be composed; also what human virtue is, and
what it is which ruins it; and further, what it is which seems to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3667]</span>ruin it but really does not. For instance (for I must complete
my argument by means of examples), each thing is subject to
one evil which ruins it: iron to rust, wool to moth, flocks of
sheep to wolves. The virtue of wine is injured when it ferments
and turns sour; of honey when it loses its natural sweetness and
is reduced to a bitter juice. Ears of corn are ruined by mildew
and drought, the fruit and leaves and branches of vines by the
mischievous host of locusts, other trees by the caterpillar, and
irrational creatures by diseases of various kinds; and not to
lengthen the list by going through all possible examples, our
own flesh is subject to fevers and palsies and a crowd of other
maladies. As then each one of these things is liable to that
which ruins its virtue, let us now consider what it is which
injures the human race, and what it is which ruins the virtue of
a human being. Most men think that there are divers things
which have this effect; for I must mention the erroneous opinions
on the subject, and after confuting them, proceed to exhibit that
which really does ruin our virtue, and to demonstrate clearly that
no one could inflict this injury or bring this ruin upon us unless
we betrayed ourselves. The multitude then, having erroneous
opinions, imagine that there are many different things which
ruin our virtue; some say it is poverty, others bodily disease,
others loss of property, others calumny, others death, and they
are perpetually bewailing and lamenting these things: and whilst
they are commiserating the sufferers and shedding tears, they
excitedly exclaim to one another, "What a calamity has befallen
such and such a man! he has been deprived of all his fortune at
a blow." Of another again one will say, "Such and such a man
has been attacked by severe sickness and is despaired of by the
physicians in attendance." Some bewail and lament the inmates
of the prison, some those who have been expelled from their
country and transported to the land of exile, others those who
have been deprived of their freedom, others those who have been
seized and made captives by enemies, others those who have
been drowned, or burnt, or buried by the fall of a house, but
no one mourns those who are living in wickedness; on the contrary,
which is worse than all, they often congratulate them, a
practice which is the cause of all manner of evils. Come then
(only, as I exhorted you at the outset, do not make a commotion),
let me prove that none of the things which have been
mentioned injure the man who lives soberly, nor can ruin his<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3668]</span>
virtue. For tell me, if a man has lost his all either at the hands
of calumniators or of robbers, or has been stripped of his goods
by knavish servants, what harm has the loss done to the virtue
of the man?</p>

<p>But if it seems well, let me rather indicate in the first place
what is the virtue of a man, beginning by dealing with the subject
in the case of existences of another kind, so as to make it
more intelligible and plain to the majority of readers.</p>

<p>What then is the virtue of a horse? is it to have a bridle
studded with gold and girths to match, and a band of silken
threads to fasten the housing, and clothes wrought in divers
colors and gold tissue, and head-gear studded with jewels, and
locks of hair plaited with gold cord? or is it to be swift and
strong in its legs, and even in its paces, and to have hoofs suitable
to a well-bred horse, and courage fitted for long journeys
and warfare, and to be able to behave with calmness in the
battle-field, and if a rout takes place, to save its rider? Is it not
manifest that these are the things which constitute the virtue of
the horse, not the others? Again, what should you say was the
virtue of asses and mules? is it not the power of carrying burdens
with contentment, and accomplishing journeys with ease, and
having hoofs like rock? Shall we say that their outside trappings
contribute anything to their own proper virtue? By no
means. And what kind of vine shall we admire? one which
abounds in leaves and branches, or one which is laden with
fruit? Or what kind of virtue do we predicate of an olive? is
it to have large boughs and great luxuriance of leaves, or to exhibit
an abundance of its proper fruit dispersed over all parts of
the tree? Well, let us act in the same way in the case of
human beings also: let us determine what is the virtue of man,
and let us regard that alone as an injury, which is destructive to
it. What then is the virtue of man? Not riches, that thou
shouldst fear poverty; nor health of body, that thou shouldst
dread sickness; nor the opinion of the public, that thou shouldst
view an evil reputation with alarm, nor life simply for its own
sake, that death should be terrible to thee; nor liberty that thou
shouldst avoid servitude: but carefulness in holding true doctrine,
and rectitude in life. Of these things not even the devil
himself will be able to rob a man, if he who possesses them
guards them with the needful carefulness, and that most malicious
and ferocious demon is aware of this.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3669]</span></p>

<p>Thus in no case will any one be able to injure a man who
does not choose to injure himself; but if a man is not willing to
be temperate, and to aid himself from his own resources, no one
will ever be able to profit him. Therefore also that wonderful
history of the Holy Scriptures, as in some lofty, large, and broad
picture, has portrayed the lives of the men of old time, extending
the narrative from Adam to the coming of Christ: and it
exhibits to you both those who are vanquished and those who
are crowned with victory in the contest, in order that it may
instruct you by means of all examples that no one will be able
to injure one who is not injured by himself, even if all the world
were to kindle a fierce war against him. For it is not stress of
circumstances, nor variation of seasons, nor insults of men in
power, nor intrigues besetting thee like snow-storms, nor a crowd
of calamities, nor a promiscuous collection of all the ills to which
mankind is subject, which can disturb even slightly the man who
is brave and temperate and watchful; just as on the contrary
the indolent and supine man who is his own betrayer cannot be
made better, even with the aid of innumerable ministrations.</p>

<h3><a name="ON_ENCOURAGEMENT_DURING_ADVERSITY" id="ON_ENCOURAGEMENT_DURING_ADVERSITY"></a>ON ENCOURAGEMENT DURING ADVERSITY</h3>

<h4>From the 'Letters to Olympias'</h4>

<p>To my Lady, the most reverend and divinely favored Deaconess
Olympias, I John, Bishop, send greeting in the
Lord: Come now, let me relieve the wound of thy despondency,
and disperse the thoughts which gather this cloud of care
around thee. For what is it which upsets thy mind, and why
art thou sorrowful and dejected? Is it because of the fierce
black storm which has overtaken the Church, enveloping all
things in darkness as of a night without a moon, and is growing
to a head every day, travailing to bring forth disastrous shipwrecks,
and increasing the ruin of the world? I know all this
as well as you; none shall gainsay it, and if you like I will form
an image of the things now taking place so as to present the
tragedy yet more distinctly to thee. We behold a sea upheaved
from the very lowest depths, some sailors floating dead upon the
waves, others engulfed by them, the planks of the ships breaking
up, the sails torn to tatters, the masts sprung, the oars<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3670]</span>
dashed out of the sailors' hands, the pilots seated on the deck,
clasping their knees with their hands instead of grasping the
rudder, bewailing the hopelessness of their situation with sharp
cries and bitter lamentations, neither sky nor sea clearly visible,
but all one deep and impenetrable darkness, so that no one can
see his neighbor; whilst mighty is the roaring of the billows, and
monsters of the sea attack the crews on every side.</p>

<p>But how much further shall I pursue the unattainable? for
whatever image of our present evils I may seek, speech shrinks
baffled from the attempt. Nevertheless, even when I look at
these calamities I do not abandon the hope of better things,
considering as I do who the Pilot is in all this&mdash;not one who
gets the better of the storm by his art, but calms the raging
waters by his rod. But if he does not effect this at the outset
and speedily, such is his custom&mdash;he does not at the beginning
put down these terrible evils; but when they have increased and
come to extremities, and most persons are reduced to despair,
then he works wondrously and beyond all expectation, thus
manifesting his own power and training the patience of those
who undergo these calamities. Do not therefore be cast down.
For there is only one thing, Olympias, which is really terrible,
only one real trial, and that is sin; and I have never ceased
continually harping upon this theme: but as for all other things,
plots, enmities, frauds, calumnies, insults, accusations, confiscation,
exile, the keen sword of the enemy, the peril of the
deep, warfare of the whole world, or anything else you like to
name, they are but idle tales. For whatever the nature of
these things may be, they are transitory and perishable, and
operate in a mortal body without doing any injury to the vigilant
soul. Therefore the blessed Paul, desiring to prove the
insignificance both of the pleasures and sorrows relating to this
life, declared the whole truth in one sentence when he said,
"For the things which are seen are temporal." Why then dost
thou fear temporal things which pass away like the stream of a
river? For such is the nature of present things, whether they
be pleasant or painful. And another prophet compared all human
prosperity not to grass, but to another material even more
flimsy, describing the whole of it "as the flower of grass." For
he did not single out any one part of it, as wealth alone, or
luxury alone, or power, or honor; but having comprised all the
things which are esteemed splendid amongst men under the one<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3671]</span>
designation of glory, he said, "All the glory of man is as the
flower of grass."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, you will say, adversity is a terrible thing and
grievous to be borne. Yet look at it again compared with
another image, and then also learn to despise it. For the railing,
and insults, and reproaches, and gibes, inflicted by enemies and
their plots, are compared to a worn-out garment and moth-eaten
wool, when God says, "Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither
be ye afraid of their revilings, for they shall wax old as doth a
garment, and like moth-eaten wool so shall they be consumed."
Therefore let none of these things which are happening trouble
thee; but ceasing to invoke the aid of this or that person, and
to run after shadows (for such are human alliances), do thou
persistently call upon Jesus whom thou servest, merely to bow
his head and in a moment of time all these evils will be
dissolved. But if thou hast already called upon him, and yet
they have not been dissolved, such is the manner of God's
dealing (for I will resume my former argument); he does not
put down evils at the outset, but when they have grown to a
head, when scarcely any form of the enemy's malice remains
ungratified, then he suddenly converts all things to a state of
tranquillity and conducts them to an unexpected settlement. For
he is not only able to turn as many things as we expect and
hope, to good, but many more, yea infinitely more. Wherefore
also Paul saith, "Now to Him who is able to do exceeding
abundantly above all that we ask or think." Could he not, for
example, have prevented the Three Children at the outset from
falling into trial? But he did not choose to do this, thereby
conferring great pain upon them. Therefore he suffered them to
be delivered into the hands of barbarians, and the furnace to be
heated to an immeasurable height and the wrath of the king to
blaze even more fiercely than the furnace, and hands and feet to
be bound with great severity, and they themselves to be cast
into the fire; and then, when all they who beheld despaired of
their rescue, suddenly and beyond all hope the wonder-working
power of God, the supreme artificer, was displayed, and shone
forth with exceeding splendor. For the fire was bound and the
bondmen were released; and the furnace became a temple of
prayer, a place of fountains and dew, of higher dignity than a
royal court, and the very hairs of their head prevailed over that
all-devouring element which gets the better even of iron and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3672]</span>
stone, and masters every kind of substance. And a solemn song
of universal praise was instituted there by these holy men,
inviting every kind of created thing to join in the wondrous
melody: and they uttered hymns of thanksgiving to God for that
they had been bound, and also burnt, as far at least as the
malice of their enemies had power; that they had been exiles
from their country, captives deprived of their liberty, wandering
outcasts from city and home, sojourners in a strange and barbarous
land: for all this was the outpouring of a grateful heart.
And when the malicious devices of their enemies were perfected
(for what further could they attempt after their death?) and the
labors of the heroes were completed, and the garland of victory
was woven, and their rewards were prepared, and nothing more
was wanting for their renown, then at last their calamities were
brought to an end, and he who caused the furnace to be kindled,
and delivered them over to that great punishment, became
himself the panegyrist of those holy heroes and the herald of
God's marvelous deed, and everywhere throughout the world
issued letters full of reverent praise, recording what had taken
place, and becoming the faithful herald of the miracles wrought
by the wonder-working God. For inasmuch as he had been an
enemy and adversary, what he wrote was above suspicion even
in the opinion of enemies.</p>

<p>Dost thou see the abundance of resource belonging to God?
his extraordinary power, his loving-kindness and care? Be not
therefore dismayed or troubled, but continue to give thanks to
God for all things, praising and invoking him; beseeching and
supplicating; even if countless tumults and troubles come upon
thee, even if tempests are stirred up before thine eyes, let none
of these things disturb thee. For our Master is not baffled by
the difficulty, even if all things are reduced to the extremity of
ruin. For it is possible for him to raise those who have fallen,
to convert those who are in error, to set straight those who have
been ensnared, to release those who have been laden with countless
sins, and make them righteous, to quicken those who are
dead, to restore lustre to decayed things, and freshness to those
who have waxen old. For if he makes things which are not to
come into being, and bestows existence on things which are
nowhere by any means manifest, how much more will he rectify
things which already exist!</p>

<h3><a name="CONCERNING_THE_STATUTES" id="CONCERNING_THE_STATUTES"></a>CONCERNING THE STATUTES</h3>

<h4>From Homily VIII.</h4>

<p>Knowing these things, let us take heed to our life: and let us
not be earnest as to the goods that perish; neither as to
the glory that goeth out; nor as to that body which
groweth old; nor as to that beauty which is fading; nor as to
that pleasure which is fleeting: but let us expend all our care
about the soul, and let us provide for the welfare of this in every
way. For to cure the body when diseased is not an easy matter
to every one; but to cure a sick soul is easy to all: and the
sickness of the body requires medicines, as well as money, for
its healing; but the healing of the soul is a thing easy to procure,
and devoid of expense. And the nature of the flesh is with
much labor delivered from those wounds which are troublesome;
for very often the knife must be applied, and medicines that are
bitter; but with respect to the soul there is nothing of this kind.
It suffices only to exercise the will and the desire, and all things
are accomplished. And this hath been the work of God's providence.
For inasmuch as from bodily sickness no great injury
could arise (for though we were not diseased, yet death would in
any case come, and destroy and dissolve the body); but everything
depends upon the health of our souls; this being by far
the more precious and necessary, he hath made the medicining
of it easy, and void of expense or pain. What excuse therefore
or what pardon shall we obtain, if when the body is sick, and
money must be expended on its behalf, and physicians called in,
and much anguish endured, we make this so much a matter of
our care (though what might result from that sickness could be
no great injury to us), and yet treat the soul with neglect?
And this, when we are neither called upon to pay down money,
nor to give others any trouble, nor to sustain any sufferings; but
without any of all these things, by only choosing and willing,
have it in our power to accomplish the entire amendment of it:
and knowing assuredly that if we fail to do this, we shall sustain
the extreme sentence, and punishments, and penalties, which
are inexorable! For tell me, if any one promised to teach thee
the healing art in a short space of time, without money or labor,
wouldst thou not think him a benefactor? Wouldst thou not submit
both to do and to suffer all things, whatsoever he who prom<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3674]</span>ised
these things commanded? Behold now, it is permitted thee
without labor to find a medicine for wounds, not of the body,
but of the soul, and to restore it to a state of health without
any suffering! Let us not be indifferent to the matter! For
pray what is the pain of laying aside anger against one who
hath aggrieved thee? It is a pain indeed to remember injuries,
and not to be reconciled! What labor is it to pray, and to
ask for a thousand good things from God, who is ready to give?
What labor is it, not to speak evil of any one? What difficulty
is there in being delivered from envy and ill-will? What trouble
is it to love one's neighbor? What suffering is it not to utter
shameful words, nor to revile, nor to insult another? What
fatigue is it not to swear? for again I return to this same admonition.
The labor of swearing is indeed exceedingly great.
Oftentimes, whilst under the influence of anger or wrath, we
have sworn, perhaps, that we would never be reconciled to those
who have injured us.</p>

<p>I am now for the sixth day admonishing you in respect of
this precept. Henceforth I am desirous to take leave of you,
meaning to abstain from the subject, that ye may be on your
guard. There will no longer be any excuse or allowance for
you; for of right, indeed, if nothing had been said on this
matter, it ought to have been amended of yourselves, for it is
not a thing of an intricate nature, or that requires great preparation.
But since ye have enjoyed the advantage of so much
admonition and counsel, what excuse will ye have to offer, when
ye stand accused before that dread tribunal and are required to
give account of this transgression? It is impossible to invent
any excuse; but of necessity you must either go hence amended,
or if you have not amended, be punished, and abide the
extremest penalty! Thinking therefore upon all these things,
and departing hence with much anxiety about them, exhort ye
one another, that the things spoken of during so many days
may be kept with all watchfulness in your minds; so that
whilst we are silent, ye instructing, edifying, exhorting one
another, may exhibit great improvement: and having fulfilled
all the other precepts may enjoy eternal crowns; which God
grant we may all obtain through the grace and loving-kindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2><a name="MARCUS_TULLIUS_CICERO" id="MARCUS_TULLIUS_CICERO"></a>MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO</h2>

<h4>(106-43 B.C.)</h4>

<h4>BY WILLIAM CRANSTON LAWTON</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he outward life, the political career, of Marcus Tullius Cicero,
is to nearly all students of history a tragic and pathetic
story. He seems peculiarly unfitted to the people and the
time in which his lot was cast. His enlightened love for the traditions
of the past, his passionate sentiment of patriotism, his forceful
eloquence as a debater in the Senate or as an orator in the Forum,&mdash;these
qualities of a Burke or a Webster stand out violently dissevered
from the lurid history of his time. This humane scholarly life was
flung into the midst of the wildest century in all Rome's grim annals;
the hundred years of civic turmoil and bloodshed, from the elder
Gracchus's murder to the death of Cleopatra.</p>

<p>And yet such was the marvelous activity, the all-sided productiveness,
of the Ciceronian intellect, that perhaps no human mind has
ever so fully exploited all its powers. Moreover, in each intellectual
field which he entered, the chances of time have removed nearly
every Roman rival, leaving us no choice save to accept Cicero's
guidance. There was many another orator, and history of eloquence.
There were other practical treatises on rhetoric. Many a notable
correspondence was actually preserved and published, though now
lost. Even his free transcriptions from Greek philosophical treatises&mdash;hastily
conned and perhaps imperfectly understood&mdash;have acquired,
through the disappearance of the Greek scrolls themselves, an ill-deserved
authority as to the tenets of the Epicurean and other
schools.</p>

<p>Before and above all else, Cicero was a pleader. Out of that
activity grew his ill-starred political activity, while his other literary
tastes were essentially but a solace in times of enforced retirement.
With the discussion of his oratory, therefore, we may best combine
a rapid outline of his life.</p>

<p>By their common birthplace, Arpinum, and by a slight tie of
kinship, Cicero was associated with Marius; and he began life, like
Disraeli, with radical sympathies. He was the elder son of a
wealthy Roman citizen, but no ancestor had ennobled the family by
attaining curule office. After a most thorough course of training in
Latin and Greek, Cicero began to "practice law." The pleader in
ancient Rome was supposed to receive no fee, and even more than<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3676]</span>
with us, found his profession the natural stepping-stone to political
honors.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-six, Cicero (in 80 B.C.) defended his first
important client in a criminal case. In the closing days of the Sullan
proscriptions, young Roscius, of Ameria in Umbria, was charged
with murdering his own father in Rome. A pair of Roscius's kinsmen
were probably the real culprits, and had arranged with Chrysogonus,
a wealthy freedman and favorite of the Dictator, to insert the
dead man's name among the outlawed victims and to divide the
confiscated estate. The son was persecuted because he resisted this
second outrage. Cicero says he is himself protected by his obscurity,
though no other advocate has dared to plead for the unlucky youth.
In our present text there are some audacious words aimed at Sulla's
own measures: they were probably sharpened in a later revision.
The case was won, against general expectation. Cicero may have
played the hero that day: certainly the brief remainder of Sulla's
life was spent by the young democratic pleader traveling in the
East,&mdash;"for his health," as Plutarch adds, truly enough. At this time
his style was chastened and his manner moderated by the teachers
of Athens, and especially by Molo in Rhodes.</p>

<p>Cicero's qu&aelig;storship was passed in Sicily, 75-4 B.C. Here he
knit close friendships with many Greek provincials, and did a creditable
piece of arch&aelig;ological work by rediscovering Archimedes's tomb.
His impeachment of Verres for misgovernment in Sicily was in 70
B.C. This time the orator runs a less desperate risk. Since Sulla's
death the old constitution has languidly revived. Speech was comparatively
free and safe. The "knights" or wealthy middle class,&mdash;Cicero's
own,&mdash;deprived by Sulla of the right to sit as the jurors in
impeachment trials like Verres's, partially regain the privilege in this
very year. The overwhelming mass of evidence made Verres flee
into exile, and Hortensius, till then leader of the Roman bar, threw
up the case in despair. Nevertheless Cicero published the stately
series of orations he had prepared. They form the most vivid picture,
and the deadliest indictments ever drawn, of Roman provincial
government,&mdash;and of a ruthless art-collector. Cicero instantly became
the foremost among lawyers. Moreover, this success made Cicero a
leader in the time of reaction after Sulla, and hastened his elevation
to posts where only men of sterner nature could be fully and permanently
successful.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 629px;">
<a name="CICERO" id="CICERO"></a>
<span class="caption">CICERO.</span>
<img src="images/cicero.jpg" width="629" height="1024" alt="CICERO." title="CICERO." />
</div>

<p>Pompey, born in the same year, was at this time leading the
revolt against Sulla's measures. The attachment now formed, the
warmer hearted Cicero never wholly threw off. The young general's
later foreign victories are nowhere so generously set forth as in
Cicero's too-rhetorical plea "for the Manilian Law," in 66 B.C.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3677]</span>Pompey was then wintering in the East, after sweeping piracy in a
single summer from the Mediterranean. This plea gave him the
larger command against Mithridates. Despite the most extravagant
laudation, however, Pompey remains, here as elsewhere, one of those
large but vague and misty figures that stalk across the stage of
history without ever once turning upon us a fully human face. Far
more distinct than he, there looms above him the splendid triumphal
pageant of Roman imperialism itself.</p>

<p>Cicero's unrivaled eloquence won him not only a golden shower of
gifts and legacies, but also the pr&aelig;torship and consulship at the
earliest legal age. Perhaps some of the old nobles foresaw and
prudently avoided the Catilinarian storm of 63 B.C. The common
dangers of that year, and the pride of assured position, may have
hastened the full transfer of Cicero's allegiance to the old senatorial
faction. Tiberius Gracchus, boldly praised in January, has become
for Cicero a notorious demagogue; his slayers instead are the undoubted
patriots, in the famous harangues of November. These latter,
by the way, were certainly under the file three years afterward,&mdash;and
it is not likely that we read any Ciceronian speech just as it
was delivered. If there be any thread of consistency in Cicero's public
career, it must be sought in his long but vain hope to unite the
nobility and the <i>equites</i>, in order to resist the growing proletariat.</p>

<p>The eager vanity with which Cicero seized the proud title "Father
of the fatherland" is truly pathetic. The summary execution of the
traitors may have been prompted by that physical timidity so often
associated with the scholarly temperament. Whether needless or
not, the act returned to plague him.</p>

<p>The happiest effort of the orator in his consular year was the
famous plea for Murena. This consul-elect for 62 was a successful
soldier. Catiline must be met in the spring "in the jaws of Etruria."
Cicero's dearest friend, Servius Sulpicius Rufus, a defeated candidate,
accused Murena of bribery. The conditions of Roman politics, the
character of Sulpicius, the tone of Cicero himself, bid us adjudge
Murena probably guilty. Cicero had supported Sulpicius, but now
feels it is no time to "go behind the returns," or to replace a bold
soldier by a scholarly lawyer.</p>

<p>To win his case Cicero must heap ridicule upon his own profession
in his friend's person, and upon Stoic philosophy, represented
by Cato, Sulpicius's chief advocate. This he did so successfully that
Cato himself exclaimed with a grim smile, "What a jester our consul
is!" Cicero won his case&mdash;and kept his friends. This speech is
cited <i>sixteen times</i> by Quintilian, and is a model of forensic ingenuity,
wit, and grace. Its patriotism may be plausibly defended, but
hardly its moral standards.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3678]</span></p>
<p>The next year produced the famous and successful defense of
Cluentius,&mdash;probably guilty of poisoning,&mdash;and also the most delightful
of all Cicero's speeches, the oration for the poet Archias.
Whether the old Greek's claim to Roman citizenship was beyond
cavil we neither know nor greatly care. The legal argument is suspiciously
brief. The praise of literature and the scholarly life, however,
has re-echoed ever since, and still reaches all hearts. Brother
Quintus, sitting in judgment as pr&aelig;tor, is pleasantly greeted.</p>

<p>This is the culmination in Cicero's career of success. Some boastful
words uttered in these days make us doubt if he remembered
Solon's and Sophocles's maxim, "Count no life happy before its
close." The fast-growing power of C&aelig;sar presently made the two
successful generals Pompey and Crassus his political tools. Cicero
refused to enter, on similar conditions, the cabal later known as the
"First Triumvirate." C&aelig;sar, about to depart for his long absence in
Gaul, might well regard the patriotic and impulsive orator as the
most serious source of possible opposition in his absence. Marcus
refused, himself, to go along to Gaul a-soldiering, though Brother
Quintus accepted a commission and served creditably. At last,
reluctantly, C&aelig;sar suffered Cicero's personal enemy Clodius to bring
forward a decree outlawing "those who had put Roman citizens to
death without trial" (March, 58 B.C.). Cicero meekly withdrew
from Rome, was condemned by name in absence, and his town
house and villas pillaged.</p>

<p>As to the cowardice of this hasty retreat, none need use severer
words than did the exile himself. It is the decisive event in his
career. His uninterrupted success was ended. His pride could
never recover fully from the hurt. Worst of all, he could never
again pose, even before his own eyes, as the fearless hero-patriot.
In short, C&aelig;sar, the consummate master of action and of men, had
humanely but decisively crippled the erratic yet patriotic rhetorician.</p>

<p>In little more than a year the bad conduct of Clodius, the personal
good-will of the "triumvirs," and the whirligig of politics,
brought round Cicero's return from Greece. His wings were however
effectively clipped. After a brief and slight flutter of independence,
he made full, even abject, submission to the dominant
C&aelig;sarian faction. This was in 56 B.C. The next five years, inglorious
politically, were however full of activity in legal oratory and
other literary work. In his eloquent defense of C&aelig;lius Rufus,
charged with an attempt to poison Clodia, Cicero perforce whitewashes,
or at least paints in far milder colors than of old, Catiline,
C&aelig;lius's lifelong friend! A still less pleasing feature is the abusive
attack on the famous and beautiful Clodia, probably the "Lesbia" of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3679]</span>
Catullus. (The unhappy young poet seems to have preceded C&aelig;lius
in the fickle matron's favor.)</p>

<p>The events of the year 52 well illustrate the unfitness of Cicero
for politics in such an age. Rome was full of street brawls, which
Pompey could not check. The orator's old enemy Clodius, at the
head of his bravos, was slain by a fellow ruffian Milo in January.
At Milo's trial in April Cicero defended him, or attempted to do so.
A court-room encircled by a yelling mob and guarded by Pompey's
legions caused him to break down altogether. As afterward written
out at leisure, the speech is a masterpiece of special pleading. The
exiled Milo's criticism on it is well known: "I'm glad you never
delivered it: I should not now be enjoying the mullets of Marseilles."</p>

<p>The year 51-50 Cicero spent, most unwillingly, as proconsular
governor in far-off Cilicia. Though really humane and relatively
honest, he accumulated in these few months a handsome sum in
"gifts" from provincials and other perquisites. Even Cicero was a
Roman.</p>

<p>Meantime the civil war had all but broken out at home. Cicero
hesitated long, and the correspondence with Atticus contains exhaustive
analyses of his motives and temptations. His na&iuml;ve selfishness
and vanity at times in these letters seem even like self-caricature.
Yet through it all glimmers a vein of real though bewildered patriotism.
Still the craving for a triumph&mdash;he had fought some savage
mountain clans in Asia Minor!&mdash;was hardly less dominant.</p>

<p>Repairing late and with many misgivings to Pompey's camp in
Epirus, Cicero seems to have been there a "not unfeared, half-welcome"
and critical guest. Illness is his excuse for absence from the
decisive battle. He himself tells us little of these days. As Plutarch
relates the tale, after Pompey's flight to Egypt Cicero refused the
supreme command, and was thereupon threatened with death by
young Gneius Pompey; but his life was saved by Cato.</p>

<p>One thing at least is undisputed. The last man to decide for
Pompey's cause, he was the first to hurry back to Italy and crave
C&aelig;sar's grace! For many months he waited in ignoble retirement,
fearing the success of his deserted comrades even more than C&aelig;sar's
victory. It is this action that gives the <i>coup de grace</i> to Cicero's
character as a hero. With whatever misgivings, he had chosen his
side. Whatever disturbing threats of violent revenge after victory he
heard in Pompey's camp, he awaited the decisive battle. Then there
remained, for any brave man, only constancy in defeat&mdash;or a fall
upon his sword.</p>

<p>Throughout C&aelig;sar's brief reign,&mdash;or long dictatorship,&mdash;from 48
to 44, Cicero is the most stately and the most obsequious of courtiers.
For him who would plead for clemency, or return thanks for<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3680]</span>
mercy accorded, at a despot's footstool, there are no more graceful
models than the 'Pro Ligario' and the 'Pro Marcello.' C&aelig;sar himself
realized, and wittily remarked, how irksome and hateful such a
part must be to the older, vainer, more self-conscious man of the
twain.</p>

<p>Midway in this period Cicero divorced his wife after thirty years
of wedlock, seemingly from some dissatisfaction over her financial
management, and soon after married a wealthy young ward. This is
the least pleasing chapter of his private life, but perhaps the mortification
and suffering it entailed were a sufficient penalty. His only
daughter Tullia's death in 45 B.C. nearly broke the father's heart.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, Cicero was certainly not in the secret of
C&aelig;sar's assassination. Twice in letters to members of the conspiracy
in later months he begins: "How I wish you had invited me to your
glorious banquet on the Ides of March." "There would have been
no remnants," he once adds. That is, Antony would not have been
left alive.</p>

<p>We have now reached the last two years&mdash;perhaps the most
creditable time&mdash;in Cicero's eventful life. This period runs from
March 15th, 44 B.C., to December 7th, 43 B.C. It was one long
struggle, first covert, then open, between Antony and the slayers of
C&aelig;sar. Cicero's energy and eloquence soon made him the foremost
voice in the Senate once more. For the first time since his exile, he
is now speaking out courageously his own real sentiments. His public
action is in harmony with his own convictions. The cause was
not hopeless by any means, so far as the destruction of Antony would
have been a final triumph. Indeed, that wild career seemed near its
end, when Octavian's duplicity again threw the game into his rival's
reckless hands. However, few students of history imagine that any
effective restoration of senatorial government was possible. The peculiar
pathos of Cicero's end, patriot as he was, is this: it removed
one of the last great obstacles to the only stable and peaceful rule
Rome could receive&mdash;the imperial throne of Augustus.</p>

<p>This last period is however among the most creditable, perhaps
the most heroic, in Cicero's career. Its chief memorials are the
fourteen extant orations against Antony. The comparative sincerity
of these 'Philippics,' and the lack of private letters for much of this
time, make them important historical documents. The only one
which ranks among his greatest productions&mdash;perhaps the classic
masterpiece of invective&mdash;is the 'Second Philippic.' This was never
delivered at all, but published as a pamphlet. This unquestioned
fact throws a curious light on passages like&mdash;"He is agitated, he
perspires, he turns pale!" describing Antony at the (imaginary)
delivery of the oration. The details of the behavior of Catiline and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3681]</span>
others may be hardly more authentic. The 'Ninth Philippic' is a
heartfelt funeral eulogy on that same Sulpicius whom he had ridiculed
in the 'Pro Murena.'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The milestones into headstones turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And under each a friend."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A fragment from one of Livy's lost books says, "Cicero bore with
becoming spirit none of the ills of life save death itself." He indeed
perished not only bravely but generously, dissuading his devoted
slaves from useless resistance, and extending his neck to Antony's
assassins. Verres lived to exult at the news, and then shared his
enemy's fate, rather than give up his Greek vases to Antony! Nearly
every Roman, save Nero, dies well.</p>

<p>Upon Cicero's political career our judgment is already indicated.
He was always a patriot at heart, though often a bewildered one.
His vanity, and yet more his physical cowardice, caused some grievous
blots upon the record. His last days, and death, may atone for
all&mdash;save one. The precipitate desertion of the Pompeians is not to
be condoned.</p>

<p>The best English life of Cicero is by Forsyth; but quaint, dogged,
prejudiced old Middleton should not be forgotten. Plutarch's Cicero
"needs no bush."</p>

<p>Cicero's oratory was splendidly effective upon his emotional Italian
hearers. It would not be so patiently accepted by any Teutonic
folk. His very copiousness, however, makes him as a rule wonderfully
clear and easy reading. Quintilian well says: "From Demosthenes's
periods not a word can be spared, to Cicero's not one could
be added."</p>

<p>Despite the rout of Verres and of Catiline, the merciless dissection
of Clodia, and the statelier thunders of the 'Philippics,' Cicero
was most successful and happiest when "defending the interests of
his friends." Perhaps the greatest success against justice was the
'Pro Cluentio,' which throws so lurid a light on ante-Borgian Italian
criminology. This speech is especially recommended by Niebuhr to
young philologues as a nut worthy of the strongest teeth. There is
a helpful edition by Ramsay, but Hertland's 'Murena' will be a
pleasanter variation for students wearying of the beaten track followed
by the school editions. Both the failure of the 'Pro Milone'
and the world-wide success of the 'Pro Archia' bid us repeat the
vain wish, that this humane and essentially modern nature might
have fallen on a gentler age. Regarding his whole political life as
an uncongenial r&ocirc;le forced on him by fate, we return devout thanks
for <i>fifty-eight</i> orations, nearly all in revised and finished literary form!
Fragments of seventeen, and titles of still thirty more, yet remain.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3682]</span>
From all his rivals, predecessors, pupils, not one authentic speech
survives.</p>

<p>The best complete edition of the orations with English notes is by
George Long, in the Bibliotheca Classica. The 'Philippics' alone are
better edited by J.R. King in the Clarendon Press series. School
editions of select speeches are superabundant. They regularly include
the four Catilinarians, the Manilian, and the pleas before the dictator,
sometimes a selection from the 'Philippics' or Verrine orations.</p>

<p>There is no masterly translation comparable with the fine work
done by Kennedy for Demosthenes. The Bohn version is respectable
in quality.</p>

<p>Among Cicero's numerous works on rhetoric the chief is the 'De
Oratore.' Actually composed in 55 B.C., it is a dialogue, the scene
set in 91 B.C., the characters being the chief Roman orators of that
day. L. Crassus, who plays the host gracefully at his Tusculan
country-seat, is also the chief speaker. These men were all known
to Cicero in his boyhood, but most of them perished soon after in
the Marian proscriptions. Of real character-drawing there is little,
and all alike speak in graceful Ciceronian periods. The exposition
of the technical parts of rhetoric goes on in leisurely wise, with
copious illustrations and digressions. There is much pleasant repetition
of commonplaces. Wilkins's edition of the 'De Oratore' is a
good but not an ideal one. The introductions are most helpful.
Countless discussions on etymology, etc., in the notes, should be relegated
to the dictionaries. Instead, we crave adequate cross-references
to passages in this and other works. The notes seem to be
written too largely piecemeal, each with the single passage in mind.</p>

<p>In Cicero's 'Brutus,' written in 46 B.C., Cicero, Brutus, and Atticus
carry on the conversation, but it is mostly a monologue of Cicero
and a historical sketch of Roman oratory. The affected modesty of
the autobiographic parts is diverting. Brutus was the chief exponent
of a terse, simple, direct, oratory,&mdash;far nearer, we judge, to English
taste than the Ciceronian; and the opposition between them already
appears. A convenient American edition is that by Kellogg (Ginn).</p>

<p>The opposition just mentioned comes out more clearly in the
'Orator.' This portrays the ideal public speaker. His chief accomplishments
are summed up in versatility,&mdash;the power to adapt himself
to any case and audience. An interesting passage discusses the
rhythms of prose. This book has been elaborately edited by J.E.
Sandys. In these three dialogues Cicero says everything of importance,
at least once; and the other rhetorical works in the Corpus
may be neglected here, the more as the most practical working rhetoric
among them all, the 'Auctor ad Herennium,' is certainly not<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3683]</span>
Cicero's. It is probably by Cornificius, and is especially important
as the <i>first</i> complete prose work transmitted to us in authentic Latin
form. (Cato's 'De Re Rustica' has been "modernized.")</p>

<p>The later history of the Ciceronian correspondence is a dark and
much contested field. (The most recent discussion, with bibliography,
is by Schanz, in Iwan M&uuml;ller's Handbuch, Vol. viii., pp. 238-243.)
Probably Cicero's devoted freedman Tiro laid the foundations of our
collections. The part of Petrarch in recovering the letters during the
"Revival of Learning" was much less than has been supposed.</p>

<p>The letters themselves are in wild confusion. There are four collections,
entitled 'To Atticus,' 'To Friends,' 'To Brother Marcus,'
'To Brutus': altogether over eight hundred epistles, of which a relatively
small number are written <i>to</i> Cicero by his correspondents.
The order is not chronological, and the dates can in many cases
only be conjectured. Yet these letters afford us our chief sources
for the history of this great epoch,&mdash;and the best insight we can
ever hope to have into the private life of Roman gentlemen.</p>

<p>The style of the cynical, witty C&aelig;lius, or of the learned lawyer
Sulpicius, differs perceptibly in detail from Cicero's own; yet it is
remarkable that all seem able to write clearly if not gracefully.
Cicero's own style varies very widely. The letters to Atticus are
usually colloquial, full of unexplained allusions, sometimes made intentionally
obscure and pieced out with a Greek phrase, for fear
of the carrier's treachery! Other letters again, notably a long
'Apologia' addressed to Lentulus after Cicero's return from exile,
are as plainly addressed in reality to the public or to posterity as
are any of the orations.</p>

<p>Prof. R. Y. Tyrrell has long been engaged upon an annotated
edition of all the letters in chronological order. This will be of the
utmost value. An excellent selection, illustrating the orator's public
life chiefly, has been published by Professor Albert Watson. This
volume contains also very full tables of dates, bibliography of all
Cicero's works, and in general is indispensable for the advanced
Latin student. The same letters annotated by Professor Watson have
been delightfully translated by G. E. Jeans. To this volume, rather
than to Forsyth's biography, the English reader should turn to form
his impressions of Cicero at first hand. It is a model of scholarly&mdash;and
also literary&mdash;translation.</p>

<p>The "New Academy," to which Cicero inclined in philosophy,
was skeptical in its tendencies, and regarded absolute truth as unattainable.
This made it easier for Cicero to cast his transcriptions in
the form of dialogues, revealing the beliefs of the various schools
through the lips of the several interlocutors. Thus the 'De Finibus
Bonorum et Malorum' sets forth in three successive conversations<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3684]</span>
the ideas of Epicureans, of Stoics, and of the Academy, on the
Highest Good. It is perhaps the chief of these treatises,&mdash;though
we would still prefer to have even those later compendiums of the
Greek schools through which Cicero probably cited the chief philosophers
at second hand! J. S. Reid, an eminent English scholar, has
spent many years upon this dialogue, and his work includes a
masterly translation.</p>

<p>With a somewhat similar plan, the three books of the 'De Natura
Deorum' contain the views of the three schools on the Divine
Beings. The speakers are Cicero's Roman contemporaries. This
rather sketchy work has been annotated by J. B. Mayor in his usual
exhaustive manner. The now fragmentary dialogue entitled 'The
Republic,' and its unfinished supplement 'The Laws,' were composed
and named in avowed rivalry with Plato's two largest works,
but fail to approach the master. The Roman Constitution is
defended as the ideal mingling of monarchy, aristocracy, and
democracy. The student of pure literature can for the most part
neglect these, and others among the hastily written philosophic
works, with the explicit approval of so indefatigable a student as
Professor B. L. Gildersleeve.</p>

<p>The chief fragment preserved of the 'Republic' is the 'Dream of
Scipio.' Its dependence on the vision at the close of Plato's 'Republic'
should be carefully observed. It may be fairly described as a
free translation and enlargement from Greek originals, of which
Plato's passage is the chief. Plagiarism was surely viewed quite
otherwise then than now. Still, the Roman additions and modifications
are interesting also,&mdash;and even as a translator Cicero is no
ordinary cicerone! Moreover, in this as in so many other examples,
the Latin paraphrase had a wider and more direct influence than
the original. It has been accepted with justice ever since, as the
final and most hopeful pagan word in favor of the soul's immortality.
The lover of Chaucer will recall the genial paraphrase of 'Scipio's
Dream' in the 'Parlament of Foules' (stanzas 5-12). We give below,
entire, in our quotations from Cicero, the masterly version of the
'Dream,' prepared by Prof. T. R. Lounsbury for his edition of Chaucer's
poems. The speaker is the younger Scipio Africanus, and his
visit to Africa as a subaltern here described was in 149 B.C., three
years previous to his own decisive campaign against Carthage which
ended in the destruction of the city.</p>

<p>Cicero shared in full the Roman tendency to give a practical, an
ethical turn to all metaphysical discussion. This is prominent in the
popular favorite among his larger volumes, the 'Tusculan Disputations.'
In each of the five related books a thesis is stated negatively,
to be triumphantly reversed later on:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3685]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(1) "Death seems to me an evil."</p>

<p>(2) "I think pain the greatest of all evils."</p>

<p>(3) "Misery seems to me to befall the wise man."</p>

<p>(4) "It does not appear to me that the wise man can be secure
from distress of mind."</p>

<p>(5) "Character does not seem to me sufficient for happiness in
life."</p>
</div>

<p>The original portion of this work is relatively large, and many
Roman illustrations occur. Dr. Peabody has included the Tusculans,
the two brief essays next mentioned, and the 'De Officiis,' in his
excellent series of versions (Little, Brown and Company).</p>

<p>The little dialogue on 'Old Age' is perhaps most read of all
Cicero's works. Its best thoughts, it must be confessed, are freely
borrowed from the opening pages of Plato's 'Republic.' Still, on
this theme of universal human interest, the Roman also offers much
pleasant food for thought. The moderation of the Greek is forgotten
by Cicero, the professional advocate and special pleader, who almost
cries out to us at last:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Grow old along with me:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The best is yet to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last of life, for which the first was made!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was written in 45-4 B.C. The other little essay 'On Friendship'
does not deserve to be bound up in such good company, though it
usually is so edited. Bacon's very brief essay has more meat in it.
Cicero had many good friends, but fully trusted hardly any one of
them&mdash;not even Atticus. It was an age which put friendship to
fearful trial, and the typical Roman seems to us rather selfish and
cold. Certainly this essay is in a frigid tone. Professor Gildersleeve,
I believe, has likened it to a treatise of Xenophon on hunting, so systematically
is the <i>pursuit</i> of friends discussed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most practical among Roman Manuals of Morals is
the treatise on Duties ('De Officiis'), in three books. Here the personal
experience of sixty years is drawn upon, avowedly for the
edification of young Marcus, the author's unworthy son. This sole
Ciceronian survivor of Antony's massacres lived to be famous for his
capacity in wine-drinking, and to receive officially, as consul under
Augustus, the news of Antony's final defeat and death&mdash;a dramatic
revenge.</p>

<p>Most of these philosophic treatises were composed near the end
of Cicero's life, largely in one marvelously productive year, 45-4 B.C.,
just previous to the slaying of C&aelig;sar. Not all even of the extant
works have been catalogued here. The 'Academica' and 'De
Divinatione' should at least be mentioned.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3686]</span></p>
<p>Such were Cicero's distractions, when cut off from political life
and oratory, and above all when bereft by Tullia's death. The especial
'Consolatio,' composed to regain his courage after this blow,
must head the list of lost works. It took a most pessimistic view of
human life, for which it was reproved by Lactantius. Another perished
essay, the 'Hortensius,' introducing the whole philosophic
series, upheld Milton's thesis, "How charming is divine philosophy,"
and first turned the thoughts of Augustine to serious study.</p>

<p>Cicero's poems, chiefly translations, are extant in copious fragments.
They show metrical facility, a little taste, no creative imagination
at all. A final proof of his unresting activity is his attempt
to write history. Few, even among professional advocates, could have
less of the temper for mere narration and truth. Indeed, reasonable
disregard for the latter trammel is frankly urged upon a friend who
was to write upon the illustrious moments of Cicero's own career!</p>

<p>We said at first that the caprice of fate had exaggerated some
sides of Cicero's activity, by removing all competitors. In any case,
however, his supremacy among Italian orators, and in the ornate discursive
school of eloquence generally, could not have been questioned.</p>

<p>Yet more: As a stylist, he lifted a language hitherto poor in
vocabulary, and stiff in phrase, to a level it never afterward surpassed.
Many words he successfully coined, chiefly either by translation
or free imitation of Greek originals. His clear, copious,
rhythmical phrase was even more fully his own creation. Indeed, at
the present moment, four or five great forms of living speech testify
to Cicero's amazing mastery over both word and phrase. The eloquence
of Castelar, Crispi, and Gambetta, of Gladstone and of Everett,
is shot through and through, in all its warp and woof, with golden
Ciceronian threads. The 'Archias' speaks to any appreciative student
of Western Europe, as it were, in a mother tongue which dominates
his vernacular speech. Human language, then, has become a
statelier memorial of Cicero than even his vanity can ever have
imagined.</p>

<p>(After writing the substance of this paragraph, I was glad to find
myself in close agreement with Mackail's words in his masterly little
'Latin Literature,' page 62.)</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Resum&eacute; of General Bibliography</span></h4>

<p>The chief encyclop&aelig;dia of facts and citations for this period is
the cumbrous old 'Geschichte Roms, oder Pompeius C&aelig;sar Cicero
und ihre Zeitgenossen' of W. Drumann (K&ouml;nigsberg: 1834-44). The
plan is ideally bad, being a series of <i>family chronicles</i>, while these
three men are more completely isolated from their families and kin<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3687]</span>
than any other great trio in all Roman history! The book is however
an exhaustive, inexhaustible, little acknowledged, but still
worked quarry of erudition. The best single book in English is
Watson's edition of the (selected) letters (or Jeans's translation), until
it shall be superseded by the complete annotated edition of the correspondence,
by Tyrrell.</p>

<p>Mommsen's severe judgment on Cicero is well known. The other
standard historians are less severe. Forsyth's life is not the final
word on the subject by any means, but gives a good general view.
The stately Ciceronian Lexicon by Merguet, already complete for the
orations, will eventually provide a complete concordance and copious
elucidation for all the works. The most accessible complete edition
of Cicero's writings in Latin is by Baiter and Kayser, in eleven volumes.
The Index Nominum alone fills four hundred closely printed
pages of Vol. xi. The great critical edition is that of Orelli (Zurich:
1826-38).</p>

<p>On Cicero as an author, and indeed in the whole field of Latin
literature, the 'Geschichte der R&ouml;mischen Literatur' of Martin
Schanz (in I. M&uuml;ller's 'Handbuch') is most helpful, and even
readable.</p>

<h3><a name="OF_THE_OFFICES_OF_LITERATURE_AND_POETRY" id="OF_THE_OFFICES_OF_LITERATURE_AND_POETRY"></a>OF THE OFFICES OF LITERATURE AND POETRY</h3>

<h4>From the 'Oration for the Poet Archias'</h4>


<p>You ask us, O Gratius, why we are so exceedingly attached to
this man. Because he supplies us with food whereby our
mind is refreshed after this noise in the Forum, and with
rest for our ears after they have been wearied with bad language.
Do you think it possible that we could find a supply for
our daily speeches, when discussing such a variety of matters,
unless we were to cultivate our minds by the study of literature?
or that our minds could bear being kept so constantly on the
stretch if we did not relax them by that same study? But I
confess that I am devoted to those studies; let others be
ashamed of them if they have buried themselves in books without
being able to produce anything out of them for the common
advantage, or anything which may bear the eyes of men and
the light. But why need I be ashamed, who for many years
have lived in such a manner as never to allow my own love of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3688]</span>
tranquillity to deny me to the necessity or advantage of another,
or my fondness for pleasure to distract, or even sleep to delay,
my attention to such claims? Who then can reproach me, or
who has any right to be angry with me, if I allow myself as
much time for the cultivation of these studies as some take for
the performance of their own business; or for celebrating days
of festival and games; or for other pleasures; or even for the
rest and refreshment of mind and body; or as others devote to
early banquets, to playing at dice, or at ball? And this ought
to be permitted to me, because by these studies my power of
speaking and those faculties are improved, which as far as they
do exist in me have never been denied to my friends when
they have been in peril. And if that ability appears to any one
to be but moderate, at all events I know whence I derive those
principles which are of the greatest value. For if I had not
persuaded myself from my youth upwards, both by the precepts
of many masters and by much reading, that there is nothing in
life greatly to be desired except praise and honor, and that
while pursuing those things all tortures of the body, all dangers
of death and banishment are to be considered but of small
importance, I should never have exposed myself in defense of
your safety to such numerous and arduous contests, and to
these daily attacks of profligate men. But all books are full of
such precepts, and all the sayings of philosophers, and all antiquity,
are full of precedents teaching the same lesson; but all
these things would lie buried in darkness if the light of literature
and learning were not applied to them. How many images
of the bravest men, carefully elaborated, have both the Greek
and Latin writers bequeathed to us, not merely for us to look
at and gaze upon, but also for our imitation! And I, always
keeping them before my eyes as examples for my own public
conduct, have endeavored to model my mind and views by continually
thinking of those excellent men.</p>

<p>Some one will ask "What! were those identical great men,
whose virtues have been recorded in books, accomplished in all
that learning which you are extolling so highly?" It is difficult
to assert this of all of them; but still I know what answer I can
make to that question: I admit that many men have existed of
admirable disposition and virtue, who without learning, by the
almost divine instinct of their own mere nature, have been, of
their own accord as it were, moderate and wise men. I even<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3689]</span>
add this, that very often nature without learning has had more
to do with leading men to credit and to virtue, than learning
when not assisted by a good natural disposition. And I also
contend that when to an excellent and admirable natural disposition
there is added a certain system and training of education,
then from that combination arises an extraordinary perfection of
character: such as is seen in that godlike man whom our
fathers saw in their time&mdash;Africanus; and in Caius L&aelig;lius and
Lucius Furius, most virtuous and moderate men; and in that
most excellent man, the most learned man of his time, Marcus
Cato the elder: and all these men, if they had been to derive no
assistance from literature in the cultivation and practice of virtue,
would never have applied themselves to the study of it.
Though even if there were no such great advantage to be
reaped from it, and if it were only pleasure that is sought from
these studies, still I imagine you would consider it a most
reasonable and liberal employment of the mind: for other occupations
are not suited to every time, nor to every age or place;
but these studies are the food of youth, the delight of old age;
the ornament of prosperity, the refuge and comfort of adversity;
a delight at home, and no hindrance abroad; they are companions
by night, and in travel, and in the country.</p>

<p>And if we ourselves were not able to arrive at these advantages,
nor even taste them with our senses, still we ought to
admire them even when we saw them in others.... And
indeed, we have constantly heard from men of the greatest
eminence and learning that the study of other sciences was
made up of learning, and rules, and regular method; but that a
poet was such by the unassisted work of nature, and was moved
by the vigor of his own mind, and was inspired as it were by
some divine wrath. Wherefore rightly does our own great Ennius
call poets holy; because they seem to be recommended to
us by some especial gift, as it were, and liberality of the gods.
Let then, judges, this name of poet, this name which no barbarians
even have ever disregarded, be holy in your eyes, men
of cultivated minds as you all are. Rocks and deserts reply to
the poet's voice; savage beasts are often moved and arrested by
song; and shall we who have been trained in the pursuit of the
most virtuous acts refuse to be swayed by the voice of poets?
The Colophonians say that Homer was their citizen; the Chians
claim him as theirs; the Salaminians assert their right to him;<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3690]</span>
but the men of Smyrna loudly assert him to be a citizen of
Smyrna, and they have even raised a temple to him in their
city. Many other places also fight with one another for the
honor of being his birthplace.</p>

<p>They then claim a stranger, even after his death, because he
was a poet: shall we reject this man while he is alive, a man
who by his own inclination and by our laws does actually belong
to us? especially when Archias has employed all his genius with
the utmost zeal in celebrating the glory and renown of the
Roman people?  For when a young man, he touched on our
wars against the Cimbri and gained the favor even of Caius
Marius himself, a man who was tolerably proof against this sort
of study.  For there was no one so disinclined to the Muses as
not willingly to endure that the praise of his labors should be
made immortal by means of verse. They say that the great
Themistocles, the greatest man that Athens produced, said when
some one asked him what sound or whose voice he took the
greatest delight in hearing, "The voice of that by whom his own
exploits were best celebrated." Therefore, the great Marius was
also exceedingly attached to Lucius Plotius, because he thought
that the achievement which he had performed could be celebrated
by his genius. And the whole Mithridatic war, great and difficult
as it was, and carried on with so much diversity of fortune
by land and sea, has been related at length by him; and the
books in which that is sung of, not only make illustrious Lucius
Lucullus, that most gallant and celebrated man, but they do
honor also to the Roman people. For while Lucullus was general,
the Roman people opened Pontus, though it was defended
both by the resources of the king and by the character of the
country itself. Under the same general the army of the Roman
people, with no very great numbers, routed the countless hosts
of the Armenians. It is the glory of the Roman people that by
the wisdom of that same general, the city of the Cyzicenes, most
friendly to us, was delivered and preserved from all the attacks
of the kind, and from the very jaws as it were of the whole war.
Ours is the glory which will be for ever celebrated, which is
derived from the fleet of the enemy which was sunk after its
admirals had been slain, and from the marvelous naval battle off
Tenedos: those trophies belong to us, those monuments are ours,
those triumphs are ours. Therefore I say that the men by
whose genius these exploits are celebrated make illustrious at<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3691]</span>
the same time the glory of the Roman people. Our countryman
Ennius was dear to the elder Africanus; and even on the tomb
of the Scipios his effigy is believed to be visible, carved in the
marble. But undoubtedly it is not only the men who are themselves
praised who are done honor to by those praises, but the
name of the Roman people also is adorned by them. Cato, the
ancestor of this Cato, is extolled to the skies. Great honor is
paid to the exploits of the Roman people. Lastly, all those
great men, the Maximi, the Marcelli, and the Fulvii, are done
honor to, not without all of us having also a share in the panegyric....</p>

<p>Certainly, if the mind had no anticipations of posterity, and
if it were to confine all its thoughts within the same limits as
those by which the space of our lives is bounded, it would neither
break itself with such severe labors, nor would it be tormented
with such cares and sleepless anxiety, nor would it so often have
to fight for its very life. At present there is a certain virtue in
every good man, which night and day stirs up the mind with the
stimulus of glory, and reminds it that all mention of our name
will not cease at the same time with our lives, but that our fame
will endure to all posterity.</p>

<p>Do we all who are occupied in the affairs of the State, and
who are surrounded by such perils and dangers in life, appear to
be so narrow-minded as, though to the last moment of our lives
we have never passed one tranquil or easy moment, to think that
everything will perish at the same time as ourselves? Ought we
not, when many most illustrious men have with great care collected
and left behind them statues and images, representations
not of their minds but of their bodies, much more to desire to
leave behind us a copy of our counsels and of our virtues,
wrought and elaborated by the greatest genius? I thought, at
the very moment of performing them, that I was scattering and
disseminating all the deeds which I was performing, all over the
world for the eternal recollection of nations. And whether that
delight is to be denied to my soul after death, or whether, as
the wisest men have thought, it will affect some portion of my
spirit, at all events I am at present delighted with some such
idea and hope.</p>

<h3><a name="HONORS_PROPOSED_FOR_THE_DEAD_STATESMAN_SULPICIUS" id="HONORS_PROPOSED_FOR_THE_DEAD_STATESMAN_SULPICIUS"></a>HONORS PROPOSED FOR THE DEAD STATESMAN SULPICIUS</h3>

<h4>From the 'Ninth Philippic'</h4>

<p>Our ancestors indeed decreed statues to many men; public
sepulchres to few. But statues perish by weather, by violence,
by lapse of time; the sanctity of the sepulchres is
in the soil itself, which can neither be moved nor destroyed by
any violence; and while other things are extinguished, so sepulchres
become holier by age.</p>

<p>Let then this man be distinguished by that honor also, a
man to whom no honor can be given which is not deserved.
Let us be grateful in paying respect in death to him to whom
we can now show no other gratitude. And by that same step
let the audacity of Marcus Antonius, waging a nefarious war,
be branded with infamy. For when these honors have been
paid to Servius Sulpicius, the evidence of his embassy having
been insulted and rejected by Antonius will remain for everlasting.</p>

<p>On which account I give my vote for a decree in this form:
"As Servius Sulpicius Rufus, the son of Quintus, of the Lemonian
tribe, at a most critical period of the republic, and being
ill with a very serious and dangerous disease, preferred the
authority of the Senate and the safety of the republic to his
own life; and struggled against the violence and severity of his
illness, in order to arrive at the camp of Antonius, to which the
Senate had sent him; and as he, when he had almost arrived at
the camp, being overwhelmed by the violence of the disease,
has lost his life in discharging a most important office of the
republic; and as his death has been in strict correspondence to
a life passed with the greatest integrity and honor, during which
he, Servius Sulpicius, has often been of great service to the republic,
both as a private individual and in the discharge of various
magistracies: and as he, being such a man, has encountered
death on behalf of the republic while employed on an embassy;
the Senate decrees that a brazen pedestrian statue of Servius
Sulpicius be erected in the rostra in compliance with the resolution
of this order, and that his children and posterity shall have
a place round this statue of five feet in every direction, from
which to behold the games and gladiatorial combats, because he
died in the cause of the republic; and that this reason be inscribed
on the pedestal of the statue; and that Caius Pansa and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3693]</span>
Aulus Hirtius the consuls, one or both of them, if it seem good
to them, shall command the qu&aelig;stors of the city to let out a
contract for making that pedestal and that statue, and erecting
them in the rostra; and that whatever price they contract
for, they shall take care the amount is given and paid to the
contractor; and as in old times the Senate has exerted its
authority with respect to the obsequies of, and honors paid to,
brave men, it now decrees that he shall be carried to the tomb
on the day of his funeral with the greatest possible solemnity.
And as Servius Sulpicius Rufus, the son of Quintus of the
Lemonian tribe, has deserved so well of the republic as to be
entitled to be complimented with all those distinctions; the Senate
is of opinion, and thinks it for the advantage of the republic,
that the curule &aelig;dile should suspend the edict which usually
prevails with respect to funerals, in the case of the funeral of
Servius Sulpicius Rufus, the son of Quintus of the Lemonian
tribe; and that Caius Pansa the consul shall assign him a place
for a tomb in the Esquiline plain, or in whatever place shall
seem good to him, extending thirty feet in every direction,
where Servius Sulpicius may be buried; and that that shall be
his tomb, and that of his children and posterity, as having been
a tomb most deservedly given to them by the public authority."</p>

<h3><a name="OLD_FRIENDS_BETTER_THAN_NEW" id="OLD_FRIENDS_BETTER_THAN_NEW"></a>OLD FRIENDS BETTER THAN NEW</h3>

<h4>From the 'Dialogue on Friendship'</h4>

<p>But there arises on this subject a somewhat difficult question:
Whether ever new friends, if deserving friendship, are to be
preferred to old ones, just as we are wont to prefer young
colts to old horses?&mdash;a perplexity unworthy of a man; for there
ought to be no satiety of friendship as of other things: everything
which is oldest (as those wines which bear age well) ought
to be sweetest; and that is true which is sometimes said, "Many
bushels of salt must be eaten together," before the duty of
friendship can be fulfilled. But new friendships, if they afford a
hope that, as in the case of plants which never disappoint, fruits
shall appear, such are not to be rejected; yet the old one must
be preserved in its proper place, for the power of age and custom
is exceedingly great; besides, in the very case of the horse, which
I just mentioned, if there is no impediment, there is no one who<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3694]</span>
does not more pleasurably use that to which he is accustomed
than one unbroken and strange to him; and habit asserts its
power, and habit prevails, not only in the case of this, which is
animate, but also in the cases of those things which are inanimate;
since we take delight in the very mountainous or woody
scenery among which we have long dwelt.</p>

<h3><a name="HONORED_OLD_AGE" id="HONORED_OLD_AGE"></a>HONORED OLD AGE</h3>

<h4>From the 'Dialogue on Old Age'</h4>

<p>But in my whole discourse remember that I am praising that
old age which is established on the foundations of youth:
from which this is effected which I once asserted with the
great approbation of all present,&mdash;that wretched was the old age
which had to defend itself by speaking. Neither gray hairs nor
wrinkles can suddenly catch respect; but the former part of life
honorably spent, reaps the fruits of authority at the close. For
these very observances which seem light and common are marks
of honor&mdash;to be saluted, to be sought after, to receive precedence,
to have persons rising up to you, to be attended on the
way, to be escorted home, to be consulted; points which, both
among us and in other States, in proportion as they are the most
excellent in their morals, are the most scrupulously observed.
They say that Lysander the Laced&aelig;monian, whom I mentioned
a little above, was accustomed to remark that Laced&aelig;mon was
the most honorable abode for old age; for nowhere is so much
conceded to that time of life, nowhere is old age more respected.
Nay, further: it is recorded that when at Athens during the
games a certain elderly person had entered the theatre, a place
was nowhere offered him in that large assembly by his own
townsmen; but when he had approached the Laced&aelig;monians,
who, as they were ambassadors, had taken their seats together
in a particular place, they all rose up and invited the old man to
a seat; and when reiterated applause had been bestowed upon
them by the whole assembly, one of them remarked that the
Athenians knew what was right, but were unwilling to do it.
There are many excellent rules in our college, but this of which
I am treating especially, that in proportion as each man has the
advantage in age, so he takes precedence in giving his opinion;
and older augurs are preferred not only to those who are higher<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3695]</span>
in office, but even to such as are in actual command. What
pleasures, then, of the body can be compared with the privileges
of authority? which they who have nobly employed seem to me
to have consummated the drama of life, and not like inexpert
performers to have broken down in the last act. Still, old men
are peevish, and fretful, and passionate, and unmanageable,&mdash;nay,
if we seek for such, also covetous: but these are the faults
of their characters, not of their old age. And yet that peevishness
and those faults which I have mentioned have some excuse,
not quite satisfactory indeed, but such as may be admitted.
They fancy that they are neglected, despised, made a jest of;
besides, in a weak state of body every offense is irritating. All
which defects however are extenuated by good dispositions and
qualities; and this may be discovered not only in real life, but
on the stage, from the two brothers that are represented in
'The Brothers'; how much austerity in the one, and how much
gentleness in the other! Such is the fact: for as it is not every
wine, so it is not every man's life, that grows sour from old
age. I approve of gravity in old age, but this in a moderate
degree, like everything else; harshness by no means. What
avarice in an old man can propose to itself I cannot conceive:
for can anything be more absurd than, in proportion as less of
our journey remains, to seek a greater supply of provisions?</p>

<h3><a name="DEATH_IS_WELCOME" id="DEATH_IS_WELCOME"></a>DEATH IS WELCOME TO THE OLD</h3>

<h4>From the 'Dialogue on Old Age'</h4>

<p>An old man indeed has nothing to hope for; yet he is in so
much the happier state than a young one, since he has
already attained what the other is only hoping for. The
one is wishing to live long, the other has lived long. And yet,
good gods! what is there in man's life that can be called long?
For allow the latest period: let us anticipate the age of the
kings of the Tartessii. For there dwelt, as I find it recorded, a
man named Arganthonius at Gades, who reigned for eighty
years, and lived one hundred and twenty. But to my mind
nothing whatever seems of long duration, in which there is any
end. For when that arrives, then the time which has passed has
flowed away; that only remains which you have secured by virtue
and right conduct. Hours indeed depart from us, and days and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3696]</span>
months and years; nor does past time ever return, nor can it be
discovered what is to follow. Whatever time is assigned to each
to live, with that he ought to be content: for neither need the
drama be performed entire by the actor, in order to give satisfaction,
provided he be approved in whatever act he may be; nor
need the wise man live till the <i>plaudite</i>. For the short period of
life is long enough for living well and honorably; and if you
should advance further, you need no more grieve than farmers do
when the loveliness of springtime hath passed, that summer and
autumn have come. For spring represents the time of youth
and gives promise of the future fruits; the remaining seasons are
intended for plucking and gathering in those fruits. Now the
harvest of old age, as I have often said, is the recollection and
abundance of blessings previously secured. In truth, everything
that happens agreeably to nature is to be reckoned among blessings.
What, however, is so agreeable to nature as for an old
man to die? which even is the lot of the young, though nature
opposes and resists. And thus it is that young men seem to
me to die just as when the violence of flame is extinguished by
a flood of water; whereas old men die as the exhausted fire
goes out, spontaneously, without the exertion of any force: and
as fruits when they are green are plucked by force from the
trees, but when ripe and mellow drop off, so violence takes away
their lives from youths, maturity from old men; a state which
to me indeed is so delightful, that the nearer I approach to
death, I seem as it were to be getting sight of land, and at
length after a long voyage to be just coming into harbor.</p>

<h3><a name="GREAT_ORATORS" id="GREAT_ORATORS"></a>GREAT ORATORS AND THEIR TRAINING</h3>

<h4>From the 'Dialogue on Oratory'</h4>

<p>For who can suppose that amid the great multitude of students,
the utmost abundance of masters, the most eminent
geniuses among men, the infinite variety of causes, the
most ample rewards offered to eloquence, there is any other
reason to be found for the small number of orators than the
incredible magnitude and difficulty of the art?  A knowledge
of a vast number of things is necessary, without which volubility
of words is empty and ridiculous; speech itself is to be formed,
not merely by choice, but by careful construction of words; and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3697]</span>
all the emotions of the mind which nature has given to man,
must be intimately known; for all the force and art of speaking
must be employed in allaying or exciting the feelings of those
who listen. To this must be added a certain portion of grace
and wit, learning worthy of a well-bred man, and quickness and
brevity in replying as well as attacking, accompanied with a
refined decorum and urbanity. Besides, the whole of antiquity
and a multitude of examples is to be kept in the memory;
nor is the knowledge of laws in general, or of the civil law in
particular, to be neglected. And why need I add any remarks
on delivery itself, which is to be ordered by action of body, by
gesture, by look, and by modulation and variation of the voice,
the great power of which, alone and in itself, the comparatively
trivial art of actors and the stage proves; on which though all
bestow their utmost labor to form their look, voice, and gesture,
who knows not how few there are, and have ever been, to whom
we can attend with patience? What can I say of that repository
for all things, the memory; which, unless it be made the keeper
of the matter and words that are the fruits of thought and
invention, all the talents of the orator, we see, though they be
of the highest degree of excellence, will be of no avail? Let
us then cease to wonder what is the cause of the scarcity of
good speakers, since eloquence results from all those qualifications,
in each of which singly it is a great merit to labor successfully;
and let us rather exhort our children, and others
whose glory and honor is dear to us, to contemplate in their
minds the full magnitude of the object, and not to trust that
they can reach the height at which they aim by the aid of the
precepts, masters, and exercises that they are all now following,
but to understand that they must adopt others of a different
character.</p>

<p>In my opinion, indeed, no man can be an orator possessed
of every praiseworthy accomplishment unless he has attained
the knowledge of everything important, and of all liberal arts;
for his language must be ornate and copious from knowledge,
since unless there be beneath the surface matter understood
and felt by the speaker, oratory becomes an empty and almost
puerile flow of words....</p>

<p>"I am then of opinion," said Crassus, "that nature and
genius in the first place contribute most aid to speaking; and
that to those writers on the art to whom Antonius just now<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3698]</span>
alluded, it was not skill and method in speaking, but natural
talent that was wanting; for there ought to be certain lively
powers in the mind and understanding, which may be acute to
invent, fertile to explain and adorn, and strong and retentive to
remember; and if any one imagines that these powers may be
acquired by art (which is false, for it is very well if they can
be animated and excited by art; but they certainly cannot by art
be ingrafted or instilled, since they are all the gifts of nature),
what will he say of those qualities which are certainly born with
the man himself&mdash;volubility of tongue, tone of voice, strength of
lungs, and a peculiar conformation and aspect of the whole
countenance and body?  I do not say that art cannot improve
in these particulars (for I am not ignorant that what is good
may be made better by education, and what is not very good
may be in some degree polished and amended); but there are
some persons so hesitating in their speech, so inharmonious in
their tone of voice, or so unwieldy and rude in the air and
movements of their bodies, that whatever power they possess
either from genius or art, they can never be reckoned in the
number of accomplished speakers; while there are others so happily
qualified in these respects, so eminently adorned with the
gifts of nature, that they seem not to have been born like other
men, but molded by some divinity.  It is indeed a great task
and enterprise for a person to undertake and profess that while
every one else is silent, he alone must be heard on the most
important subjects, and in a large assembly of men; for there is
scarcely any one present who is not sharper and quicker to discover
defects in the speaker than merits; and thus whatever
offends the hearer effaces the recollection of what is worthy of
praise.  I do not make these observations for the purpose of
altogether deterring young men from the study of oratory, even
if they be deficient in some natural endowments. For who does
not perceive that to C. C&aelig;lius, my contemporary, a new man,
the mere mediocrity in speaking which he was enabled to attain
was a great honor?  Who does not know that Q. Varius, your
equal in age, a clumsy uncouth man, has obtained his great popularity
by the cultivation of such faculties as he has?</p>

<p>"But as our inquiry regards the complete orator, we must
imagine in our discussion an orator from whom every kind of
fault is abstracted, and who is adorned with every kind of
merit. For if the multitude of suits, if the variety of causes, if<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3699]</span>
the rabble and barbarism of the forum, afford room for even
the most wretched speakers, we must not for that reason take
our eyes from the object of our inquiry. In those arts in
which it is not indispensable usefulness that is sought, but liberal
amusement for the mind, how nicely, how almost fastidiously,
do we judge! For there are no suits or controversies
which can force men, though they may tolerate indifferent orators
in the forum, to endure also bad actors upon the stage.
The orator therefore must take the most studious precaution not
merely to satisfy those whom he necessarily must satisfy, but to
seem worthy of admiration to those who are at liberty to judge
disinterestedly. If you would know what I myself think, I will
express to you, my intimate friends, what I have hitherto never
mentioned, and thought that I never should mention. To me,
those who speak best and speak with the utmost ease and
grace, appear, if they do not commence their speeches with
some timidity, and show some confusion in the exordium, to
have almost lost the sense of shame; though it is impossible that
such should not be the case: for the better qualified a man is to
speak, the more he fears the difficulties of speaking, the uncertain
success of a speech, and the expectation of the audience.
But he who can produce and deliver nothing worthy of his subject,
nothing worthy of the name of an orator, nothing worthy
the attention of his audience, seems to me, though he be ever
so confused while he is speaking, to be downright shameless; for
we ought to avoid a character for shamelessness, not by testifying
shame, but by not doing that which does not become us.
But the speaker who has no shame (as I see to be the case with
many) I regard as deserving not only of rebuke but of personal
castigation. Indeed, what I often observe in you I very frequently
experience in myself; that I turn pale in the outset of
my speech, and feel a tremor through my whole thoughts, as it
were, and limbs. When I was a young man, I was on one occasion
so timid in commencing an accusation, that I owed to Q.
Maximus the greatest of obligations for immediately dismissing
the assembly as soon as he saw me absolutely disheartened and
incapacitated through fear." Here, they all signified assent,
looked significantly at one another, and began to talk together;
for there was a wonderful modesty in Crassus, which however
was not only no disadvantage to his oratory, but even an assistance
to it, by giving it the recommendation of probity.</p>

<p>&AElig;gypta arrived here on the 12th of April. Although he
reported that you were now quite rid of your fever and
going on very well, he nevertheless caused me some
anxiety by his report that you were not able to write to me, the
more so because Hermia, who ought to have been here on the

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The family affection of Cicero might be illustrated by many such letters
as the following:]</p></div>

<p>It being now eleven days since I left you, I am scrawling this
little bit of a note just as I am leaving my country-house
before it is light. I think of being at my place at Anagnia
to-day, and Tusculum to-morrow; only one day there, so that I
shall come up all right to time on the 28th; and oh, if I could
but run on at once to embrace my Tullia and give Attica a kiss!
Talking of this, by-the-by, do please write and let me know
while I am stopping at Tusculum what her prattle is like, or if
she is away in the country, what her letters to you are about.
Meanwhile either send or give her my love, and Pilia too. And

me anything you can find to say?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3701]</span></p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I was just fastening up this letter, but your courier
has arrived here after a long night journey with your letter. I
was very sorry, you may be sure, to find on reading it that
Attica is feverish. Everything else that I was waiting for I
now know from your note; but when you tell me that to have a
little fire in the morning "<i>sent le vieillard</i>," I retort <i>il le sent
plus</i> for one's poor old memory to begin to totter: because it
was the 29th I had promised to Axius; the 30th to you; and the
day of my arrival, the 31st, to Quintus. So take that for yourself&mdash;you

<h3><a name="SULPICIUS_CONSOLES_CICERO" id="SULPICIUS_CONSOLES_CICERO"></a>SULPICIUS CONSOLES CICERO AFTER HIS DAUGHTER
TULLIA'S DEATH</h3>

<p>For some time after I had received the information of the
death of your daughter Tullia, you may be sure that I
bore it sadly and heavily, as much indeed as was right for
me. I felt that I shared that terrible loss with you; and that
had I but been where you are, you on your part would not have
found me neglectful, and I on mine should not have failed to
come to you and tell you myself how deeply grieved I am. And
though it is true that consolations of this nature are painful
and distressing, because those [dear friends and relations] upon
whom the task naturally devolves are themselves afflicted with a
similar burden, and incapable even of attempting it without
many tears, so that one would rather suppose them in need of
the consolations of others for themselves than capable of doing
this kind office to others, yet nevertheless I have decided to
write to you briefly such reflections as have occurred to me on
the present occasion; not that I imagine them to be ignored by
you, but because it is possible that you may be hindered by
your sorrow from seeing them as clearly as usual.</p>

<p>What reason is there why you should allow the private grief
which has befallen you to distress you so terribly? Recollect
how fortune has hitherto dealt with us: how we have been<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3702]</span>
bereft of all that ought to be no less dear to men than their
own children&mdash;of country, position, rank, and every honorable
office. If one more burden has now been laid upon you, could
any addition be made to your pain? Or is there any heart that
having been trained in the school of such events, ought not now
to be steeled by use against emotion, and think everything after
them to be comparatively light?</p>

<p>Or it is for her sake, I suppose, that you are grieving? How
many times must you have arrived at the same conclusion as
that into which I too have frequently fallen, that in these days
theirs is not the hardest lot who are permitted painlessly to
exchange their life for the grave! Now what was there at the
present time that could attach her very strongly to life? what
hope? what fruition? what consolation for the soul? The prospect
of a wedded life with a husband chosen from our young
men of rank? Truly, one would think it was always in your
power to choose a son-in-law of a position suitable to your rank
out of our young men, one to whose keeping you would feel you
could safely intrust the happiness of a child. Or that of being
a joyful mother of children, who would be happy in seeing
them succeeding in life; able by their own exertions to maintain
in its integrity all that was bequeathed them by their father;
intending gradually to rise to all the highest offices of the State;
and to use that liberty to which they were born for the good of
their country and the service of their friends. Is there any one
of these things that has not been taken away before it was
given? But surely it is hard to give up one's children? It is
hard; but this is harder still&mdash;that they should bear and suffer
what we are doing.</p>

<p>A circumstance which was such as to afford me no light consolation
I cannot but mention to you, in the hope that it may
be allowed to contribute equally towards mitigating your grief.
As I was returning from Asia, when sailing from &AElig;gina in the
direction of Megara, I began to look around me at the various
places by which I was surrounded. Behind me was &AElig;gina, in
front Megara; on the right the Pir&aelig;us, on the left Corinth;
all of them towns that in former days were most magnificent,
but are now lying prostrate and in ruins before one's eyes. "Ah
me," I began to reflect to myself, "we poor feeble mortals, who
can claim but a short life in comparison, complain as though a
wrong was done us if one of our number dies in the course of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3703]</span>
nature, or has met his death by violence; and here in one spot
are lying stretched out before me the corpses of so many cities!
Servius, be master of yourself, and remember that it is the lot of
man to which you have been born." Believe me, I found
myself in no small degree strengthened by these reflections.
Let me advise you too, if you think good, to keep this reflection
before your eyes. How lately at one and the same time have
many of our most illustrious men fallen! how grave an encroachment
has been made on the rights of the sovereign people of
Rome! every province in the world has been convulsed with the
shock: if the frail life of a tender woman has gone too, who
being born to the common lot of man must needs have died in
a few short years, even if the time had not come for her now,
are you thus utterly stricken down?</p>

<p>Do you then also recall your feelings and your thoughts from
dwelling on this subject, and as beseems your character bethink
yourself rather of this: that she has lived as long as life was of
value to her; that she has passed away only together with her
country's freedom; that she lived to see her father elected Pr&aelig;tor,
Consul, Augur; that she had been the wife of young men
of the first rank; that after enjoying well-nigh every blessing
that life can offer, she left it only when the Republic itself was
falling. The account is closed, and what have you, what has
she, to charge of injustice against Fate? In a word, forget not
that you are Cicero&mdash;that you are he who was always wont to
guide others and give them good advice; and be not like those
quack physicians who when others are sick boast that they hold
the key of the knowledge of medicine, to heal themselves are
never able; but rather minister to yourself with your own hand
the remedies which you are in the habit of prescribing for
others, and put them plainly before your own soul. There is
no pain so great but the lapse of time will lessen and assuage
it: it is not like yourself to wait until this time comes, instead
of stepping forward by your philosophy to anticipate that result.
And if even those who are low in the grave have any consciousness
at all, such was her love for you and her tenderness for all
around her that surely she does not wish to see this in you.
Make this a tribute then to her who is dead; to all your friends
and relations who are mourning in your grief; and make it to
your country also, that if in anything the need should arise she
may be able to trust to your energy and guidance. Finally,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3704]</span>
since such is the condition we have come to, that even this consideration
must perforce be obeyed, do not let your conduct
induce any one to believe that it is not so much your daughter
as the circumstances of the Republic and the victory of others
which you are deploring.</p>

<p>I shrink from writing to you at greater length upon this
subject, lest I should seem to be doubtful of your own good
sense; allow me therefore to put before you one more consideration,
and then I will bring my letter to a close. We have
seen you not once but many times bearing prosperity most
gracefully, and gaining yourself great reputation thereby: let us
see at last that you are capable also of bearing adversity equally
well, and that it is not in your eyes a heavier burden than it
ought to seem; lest we should think that of all the virtues this
is the only one in which you are wanting.</p>

<p>As for myself, when I find you are more composed in mind
I will send you information about all that is being done in these
parts, and the state in which the province finds itself at present.
Farewell.</p>

<h3><a name="REPLY_TO_SULPICIUS" id="REPLY_TO_SULPICIUS"></a>CICERO'S REPLY TO SULPICIUS</h3>

<p>Yes, my dear Servius, I could indeed wish you had been with
me, as you say, at the time of my terrible trial. How
much it was in your power to help me if you had been here,
by sympathizing with, and I may almost say, sharing equally in
my grief, I readily perceive from the fact that after reading your
letter I now feel myself considerably more composed; for not
only was all that you wrote just what is best calculated to soothe
affliction, but you yourself in comforting me showed that you too
had no little pain at heart. Your son Servius however has made
it clear, by every kindly attention which such an occasion would
permit of, both how great his respect was for myself and also
how much pleasure his kind feeling for me was likely to give
you; and you may be sure that, while such attentions from him
have often been more pleasant to me, they have never made
me more grateful.</p>

<p>It is not however only your arguments and your equal share,&mdash;I
may almost call it,&mdash;in this affliction which comforts me,
but also your authority; because I hold it shame in me not to
be bearing my trouble in a way that you, a man endowed with<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3705]</span>
such wisdom, think it ought to be borne. But at times I do
feel broken down, and I scarcely make any struggle against
my grief, because those consolations fail me which under similar
calamities were never wanting to any of those other people
whom I put before myself as models for imitation. Both Fabius
Maximus, for example, when he lost a son who had held
the consulship, the hero of many a famous exploit; and Lucius
Paulus, from whom two were taken in one week; and your own
kinsman Gallus; and Marcus Cato, who was deprived of a son
of the rarest talents and the rarest virtue,&mdash;all these lived in
times when their individual affliction was capable of finding a
solace in the distinctions they used to earn from their country.
For me, however, after being stripped of all those distinctions
which you yourself recall to me, and which I had won for myself
by unparalleled exertions, only that one solace remained which
has been torn away. My thoughts were not diverted by work
for my friends, or by the administration of affairs of state;
there was no pleasure in pleading in the courts; I could not
bear the very sight of the Senate House; I felt, as was indeed
too true, that I had lost all the harvest of both my industry and
my success. But whenever I wanted to recollect that all this
was shared with you and other friends I could name, and whenever
I was breaking myself in and forcing my spirit to bear
these things with patience, I always had a refuge to go to where
I might find peace, and in whose words of comfort and sweet
society I could rid me of all my pains and griefs. Whereas now,
under this terrible blow, even those old wounds which seemed
to have healed up are bleeding afresh; for it is impossible for
me now to find such a refuge from my sorrows at home in the
business of the State, as in those days I did in that consolation
of home, which was always in store whenever I came away sad
from thoughts of State to seek for peace in her happiness. And
so I stay away both from home and from public life; because
home now is no more able to make up for the sorrow I feel
when I think of our country, than our country is for my sorrow
at home. I am therefore looking forward all the more eagerly
to your coming, and long to see you as early as that may possibly
be; no greater alleviation can be offered me than a meeting
between us for friendly intercourse and conversation. I hope
however that your return is to take place, as I hear it is, very
shortly. As for myself, while there are abundant reasons for<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3706]</span>
wanting to see you as soon as possible, my principal one is in
order that we may discuss together beforehand the best method
of conduct for present circumstances, which must entirely be
adapted to the wishes of one man only, a man nevertheless who
is far-seeing and generous, and also, as I think I have thoroughly
ascertained, to me not at all ill-disposed and to you extremely
friendly. But admitting this, it is still a matter for much deliberation
what is the line,&mdash;I do not say of action, but of keeping
quiet,&mdash;that we ought by his good leave and favor to adopt.
Farewell.</p>

<h3><a name="A_HOMESICK_EXILE" id="A_HOMESICK_EXILE"></a>A HOMESICK EXILE</h3>

<p>I send this with love, my dearest Terentia, hoping that you
and my little Tullia and my Marcus are all well.</p>

<p>From the letters of several people and the talk of everybody
I hear that your courage and endurance are simply
wonderful, and that no troubles of body or mind can exhaust
your energy.  How unhappy I am to think that with all your
courage and devotion, your virtues and gentleness, you should
have fallen into such misfortunes for me! And my sweet Tullia
too,&mdash;that she who was once so proud of her father should have
to undergo such troubles owing to him! And what shall I say
about my boy Marcus, who ever since his faculties of perception
awoke has felt the sharpest pangs of sorrow and misery? Now
could I but think, as you tell me, that all this comes in the
natural course of things, I could bear it a little easier. But it
has been brought about entirely by my own fault, for thinking
myself loved by those who were jealous of me, and turning from
those who wanted to win me.... I have thanked the
people you wanted me to, and mentioned that my information
came from you. As to the block of houses which you tell me
you mean to sell&mdash;why, good heavens! my dear Terentia, what
<i>is</i> to be done! Oh, what troubles I have to bear! And if
misfortune continues to persecute us, what will become of our
poor boy? I cannot continue to write&mdash;my tears are too much
for me; nor would I wish to betray you into the same emotion.
All I can say is that if our friends act up to their bounden
duty we shall not want for money; if they do not, you will not
be able to succeed only with your own. Let our unhappy fortunes,
I entreat you, be a warning to us not to ruin our boy,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3707]</span>
who is ruined enough already. If he only has something to save
him from absolute want, a fair share of talent and a fair share
of luck will be all that is necessary to win anything else. Do
not neglect your health; and send me messengers with letters to
let me know what goes on, and how you yourselves are faring.
My suspense in any case cannot now be long. Give my love to
my little Tullia and my Marcus.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Dyrrachium, Nov. 26.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have moved to Dyrrachium because it is not only a
free city, but very much in my interest, and quite near to Italy;
but if the bustle of the place proves an annoyance I shall betake
myself elsewhere and give you notice.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CIVIL_WAR" id="CIVIL_WAR"></a>CICERO'S VACILLATION IN THE CIVIL WAR</h3>

<p>Being in extreme agitation about these great and terrible
events, and having no means of discussing matters with you
in person, I want at any rate to avail myself of your judgment.
Now the question about which I am in doubt is simply
this: If Pompeius should fly from Italy (which I suspect he will
do), how do you think I ought to act?  To make it easier for
you to advise me, I will briefly set forth the arguments that
occur to me on both sides of the question.</p>

<p>The obligations that Pompeius laid me under in the matter of
my restoration, my own intimacy with him, and also my patriotism,
incline me to think that I ought to make my decision as
his decision, or in other words, my fortunes as his fortunes.
There is this reason also: If I stay behind and desert my post
among that band of true and illustrious patriots, I must perforce
fall completely under the yoke of one man. Now although he
frequently takes occasion to show himself friendly to me&mdash;indeed,
as you well know, anticipating this storm that is now
hanging over our heads, I took good care that he should be so
long ago&mdash;still I have to consider two different questions: first,
how far can I trust him; and secondly,&mdash;assuming it to be absolutely
certain that he is friendly disposed to me,&mdash;would it show
the brave man or the honest citizen to remain in a city where
one has filled the highest offices of peace and war, achieved
immortal deeds, and been crowned with the honors of her most<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3708]</span>
dignified priesthood, only to become an empty name and undergo
some risk, attended also very likely with considerable disgrace,
should Pompeius ever again grasp the helm? So much for this
side; see now what may be said on the other.</p>

<p>Pompeius has in our cause done nothing wisely, nothing
strongly; nothing, I may add, that has not been contrary to my
opinion and advice. I pass over those old complaints, that it
was he who himself nourished this enemy of the republic, gave
him his honors, put the sword into his hand&mdash;that it was he
who advised him to force laws through by violence, trampling on
the warnings of religion&mdash;that it was he who made the addition
of Transalpine Gaul, he who is his son-in-law, he who as
Augur allowed the adoption of Clodius; who showed more activity
in recalling me than in preventing my exile; who took it on him
to extend C&aelig;sar's term of government; who supported all his
proceedings while he was away; that he too even in his third
consulship, after he had begun to pose as a defender of the constitution,
actually exerted himself to get the ten tribunes to propose
that absence should not invalidate the election; nay more,
he expressly sanctioned this by one of his own acts, and opposed
the consul Marcus Marcellus, who proposed that the tenure of
the Gallic provinces should come to an end on the 1st of March&mdash;but
anyhow, to pass over all this, what could be more discreditable,
what more blundering, than this evacuation of the
city, or I had better say, this ignominious flight? What terms
ought not to have been accepted sooner than abandon our country?
The terms were bad? That I allow; but is anything worse
than this?  But he will win back the constitution?  When?
What preparations have been made to warrant such a hope?
Have we not lost all Picenum? have we not left open the road
to the capital? have we not abandoned the whole of our treasure,
public and private, to the foe? In a word, there is no common
cause, no strength, no centre, to draw such people together as
might yet care to show fight for the Republic. Apulia has been
chosen&mdash;the most thinly populated part of Italy, and the most
remote from the line of movement of this war: it would seem
that in despair they were looking for flight, with some easy
access to the coast. I took the charge of Capua much against
my will&mdash;not that I would evade that duty, but in a cause which
evoked no sympathy from any class as a whole, nor any openly
even from individuals (there was some of course among the good<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3709]</span>
citizens, but as languid as usual), and where I saw for myself
that the mass of the people, and all the lowest stratum, were
more and more inclined to the other side, many even longing for
a revolution, I told him to his face I would undertake to do
nothing without forces and without money. Consequently I have
had no responsibility at all, because I saw from the very first
that nothing was really intended but flight. Say that I now
follow this; then whither? Not with him; I had already set out
to join him when I found that C&aelig;sar was in those parts, so that
I could not safely reach Luceria. I must sail by the western
sea, in the depth of winter, not knowing where to steer for.
And again, what about being with my brother, or leaving him
and taking my son? How then must I act, since either alternative
will involve the greatest difficulty, the greatest mental
anxiety? And then, too, what a raid he will make on me and
my fortunes when I am out of the way&mdash;fiercer than on other
people, because he will think perhaps that in outrages on me he
holds a means of popularity. Again, these fetters, remember,&mdash;I
mean these laurels on my attendants' staves,&mdash;how inconvenient
it is to take them out of Italy! What place indeed will be safe
for me, supposing I now find the sea calm enough, before I
have actually joined him? though where that will be and how
to get there, I have no notion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, say that I stop where I am and find
some place on this side of the water, then my conduct will precisely
resemble that of Philippus, or Lucius Flaccus, or Quintus
Mucius under Cinna's reign of terror. And however this decision
ended for the last-named, yet still he at any rate used to say
that he saw what really did happen would occur, but that it was
his deliberate choice in preference to marching sword in hand
against the homes of the very city that gave him birth. With
Thrasybulus it was otherwise, and perhaps better; but still there
is a sound basis for the policy and sentiments of Mucius; as
there is also for this [which Philippus did]: to wait for your
opportunity when you must, just as much as not to lose your
opportunity when it is given. But even in this case, those staves
again of my attendants still involve some awkwardness; for say
that his feelings are friendly to me (I am not sure that this is
so, but let us assume it), then he will offer me a triumph. I
fear that to decline may be perilous&mdash;[to accept] an offense with
all good citizens. Ah, you exclaim, what a difficult, what an<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3710]</span>
insoluble problem! Yet the solution must be found; for what
can one do? And lest you should have formed the idea that I
am rather inclined towards staying because I have argued more
on that side of the question, it is quite possible, as is so frequently
the case in debates, that one side has more words, the
other more worth. Therefore I should be glad if when you give
me your opinion you would look upon me as making up my
mind quite dispassionately on a most important question. I have
a ship both at Caieta and at Brundisium.</p>

<p>But lo and behold, while I am writing you these very lines
by night in my house at Cales, in come the couriers, and here is
a letter to say that C&aelig;sar is before Corfinium, and that in Corfinium
is Domitius, with an army resolute and even eager for
battle. I do not think our chief will go so far as to be guilty
of abandoning Domitius, though it is true he had already sent
Scipio on before with two cohorts to Brundisium, and written a
dispatch to the consuls ordering that the legion enrolled by
Faustus should go under the command of one consul to Sicily:
but it is a scandal that Domitius should be left to his fate when
he is imploring him for help. There is some hope, not in my
opinion a very good one, but strong in these parts, that there
has been a battle in the Pyrenees between Afranius and Trebonius;
that Trebonius has been beaten off; that your friend
Fabius also has come over to us with all his troops; and to
crown it all, that Afranius is advancing with a strong force. If
this be so, we shall perhaps make a stand in Italy. As for me,
since C&aelig;sar's route is uncertain&mdash;he is expected about equally by
way of Capua and of Luceria&mdash;I have sent Lepta to Pompeius
with a letter, while I myself, for fear of falling in with him anywhere,
have started again for Formi&aelig;. I thought it best to let
you know this, and am writing with more composure than I have
written of late; not inserting any opinion of my own, but trying
to elicit yours.</p>

<h3><a name="CICEROS_CORRESPONDENTS" id="CICEROS_CORRESPONDENTS"></a>CICERO'S CORRESPONDENTS</h3>

<p>It seems desirable to add a few letters by other hands than
Cicero's, to indicate the manifold side-lights thrown on the inner history
of this intensely interesting period. Sulpicius's famous attempt
at consolation has already been given above. Two brief letters by
C&aelig;sar will illustrate the dictator's marvelous ability to comprehend
and control other men. Pompey's gruff rudeness forms a contrast
which is hardly accidental on the editor's part. C&aelig;lius's wit is biting
as ever; and lastly, Matius's protest against being persecuted
merely because he, who loved C&aelig;sar, openly mourned for his dead
friend, has an unconscious tone of simple heroism unequaled in the
entire correspondence.</p>

<p class="author">W. C. L.</p>


<h4>C&AElig;SAR TO CICERO</h4>

<p>You know me too well not to keep up your character as an
Augur by divining that nothing is more entirely alien from
my nature than cruelty: I will add that while my decision
is in itself a great source of pleasure to me, to find my conduct
approved by you is a triumph of gratification. Nor does the fact
at all disturb me that those people whom I have set at liberty
are reported to have gone their ways only to renew the attack
upon me; because there is nothing I wish more than that I may
ever be as true to my own character as they to theirs.</p>

<p>May I hope that you will be near town when I am there, so
that I may as usual avail myself in everything of your advice
and means of assistance? Let me assure you that I am charmed
beyond everything with your relation Dolabella, to whom I shall
acknowledge myself indeed indebted for this obligation; for his
kindliness is so great, and his feeling and affection for me are
such, that he cannot possibly do otherwise.</p>


<h4>C&AElig;SAR TO CICERO</h4>

<p>Though I had fully made up my mind that you would do
nothing rashly, nothing imprudently, still I was so far impressed
by the rumors in some quarters as to think it my
duty to write to you, and ask it as a favor due to our mutual
regard that you will not take any step, now that the scale is so
decisively turned, which you would not have thought it necessary<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3712]</span>
to take even though the balance still stood firm. For it will
really be both a heavier blow to our friendship, and a step on
your part still less judicious for yourself, if you are to be thought
not even to have bowed the knee to success&mdash;for things seem to
have fallen out as entirely favorably for us as disastrously for
them; nor yet to have been drawn by attachment to a particular
cause&mdash;for that has undergone no change since you decided
to remain aloof from their counsels;&mdash;but to have passed a stern
judgment on some act of mine, than which, from you, no more
painful thing could befall me; and I claim the right of our
friendship to entreat that you will not take this course.</p>

<p>Finally, what more suitable part is there for a good peace-loving
man, and a good citizen, than to keep aloof from civil
dissensions? There were not a few who admired this course, but
could not adopt it by reason of its danger: you, after having
duly weighed both the conclusions of friendship and the unmistakable
evidence of my whole life, will find that there is no
safer nor more honorable course than to keep entirely aloof
from the struggle.</p>


<h4>POMPEY TO CICERO</h4>

<p>To-day, the 10th of February, Fabius Vergilianus has joined
me. From him I learn that Domitius with his eleven
cohorts, and fourteen cohorts that Vibullius has brought
up, is on his way to me.  His intention was to start from Corfinium
on the 13th, Hirrus to follow soon after with five of the
cohorts. I decide that you are to come to us at Luceria; here,
I think, you will be most in safety.</p>


<h4>C&AElig;LIUS IN ROME TO CICERO IN CILICIA</h4>

<p>The capture of his Parthian Majesty and the storming of Seleuceia
itself had not been enough to compensate for missing
the sight of our doings here. Your eyes would never have
ached again if you had only seen the face of Domitius when he
was not elected! The election was important, and it was quite
clear that party feeling determined the side which people took:
only a few could be brought to acknowledge the claims of friendship.
Consequently Domitius is so furious with me that he
scarcely hates any of his most intimate friends as much as he<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3713]</span>
does me; and all the more because he thinks that it was to do
him wrong that his hopes of being in the College of Augurs are
snatched away, and that I am responsible for it. He is savage
now to see everybody so delighted at his mortification, and
myself more active than anybody, with one exception, on behalf
of Antonius.</p>

<p>As to political prospects, I have often mentioned to you that
I do not see any chance of peace lasting a year; and the nearer
that struggle which must infallibly take place, is drawing to us,
the more manifest does its danger become. The point at issue
about which our lords and masters are going to fight is this:
Pompeius has absolutely determined not to allow C&aelig;sar to be
elected consul on any terms except a previous resignation of his
army and his government, while C&aelig;sar is convinced that he
must inevitably fall if he separates himself from his army. He
offers however this compromise, that they should both of them
resign their armies. So you see their great affection for one
another and their much-abused alliance has not even dwindled
down into suppressed jealousy, but has broken out into open
war. Nor can I discover what is the wisest course to take in
my own interests: a question which I make no doubt will give
much trouble to you also. For while I have both interest and
connections among those who are on one side, on the other too it
is the cause and not the men themselves I dislike. You are not, I
feel sure, blind to the fact that where parties are divided within
a country, we are bound, so long as the struggle is carried on
with none but constitutional weapons, to support the more honorable
cause, but when we come to blows and to open war, then
the safer one; and to count that cause the better which is the
less likely to be dangerous. In the present division of feeling I
see that Pompeius will have the Senate and all judicially minded
people on his side; those who have everything to dread and little
to hope for will flock to C&aelig;sar: the army is not to be compared.
On the whole, we have plenty of time for balancing the strength
of parties and making our decision.</p>

<p>I had all but forgotten my principal reason for writing. Have
you heard of the wonderful doings of our censor Appius&mdash;&mdash;how
he is rigorously inquiring into our statues and pictures, our
amount of land, and our debts? He has persuaded himself that
his censorship is a moral soap or toilet powder. He is wrong, I
take it; for while he only wants to wash off the dirt, he is really<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3714]</span>
laying bare his veins and his flesh. Heaven and earth! you
must run, and come to laugh at the things here&mdash;&mdash;Appius questioning
about pictures and statues. You must make haste, I
assure you.</p>

<p>Our friend Curio is thought to have acted wisely in giving
way about the pay of Pompeius's troops. If I must sum up my
opinion, as you ask, about what will happen&mdash;&mdash;unless one or
other of them consents to go and fight the Parthians, I see a
great split impending, which will be settled by the sword and
by force; each is well inclined for this and well equipped. If it
could only be without danger to yourself, you would find this a
great and most attractive drama which Fortune is rehearsing.</p>


<h4>MATIUS TO CICERO</h4>

<p>I received great pleasure from your letter, because I found that
your opinion of me was what I had hoped and wished it to
be; not that I was in any doubt about it, but for the very
reason that I valued it so highly, I was most anxious that it
should remain unimpaired. Conscious however that I had done
nothing which could give offense to the feelings of any good
citizen, I was naturally the less inclined to believe that you,
adorned as you are with so many excellences of the most admirable
kind, could have allowed yourself to be convinced of anything
on mere idle report; particularly seeing that you were a
friend for whom my spontaneous attachment had been and still
was unbroken. And knowing now that it has been as I hoped,
I will answer those attacks which you have often opposed on my
behalf, as was fairly to be expected from your well-known generosity
and the friendship existing between us.</p>

<p>For I am well aware of all they have been heaping on me
since C&aelig;sar's death. They make it a reproach against me that I
go heavily for the loss of a friend, and think it cruel that one
whom I loved should have fallen, because, say they, country
must be put before friends&mdash;&mdash;as though they have hitherto been
successful in proving that his death really was the gain of the
commonwealth. But I will not enter any subtle plea; I admit
that I have not attained to your higher grades of philosophy: for
I have neither been a partisan of C&aelig;sar in our civil dissensions,&mdash;&mdash;though
I did not abandon my friend even when his action<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3715]</span>
was a stumbling-block to me,&mdash;&mdash;nor did I ever give my approval
to the civil war, or even to the actual ground of quarrel, of
which indeed I earnestly desired that the first sparks should be
trampled out. And so in the triumph of a personal friend I
was never ensnared by the charms either of place or of money;
prizes which have been recklessly abused by the rest, though they
had less influence with him than I had. I may even say that
my own private property was impaired by that act of C&aelig;sar,
thanks to which many of those who are rejoicing at C&aelig;sar's
death continued to live in their own country. That our defeated
fellow countrymen should be spared was as much an object to
me as my own safety. Is it possible then for me, who wanted
all to be left uninjured, not to feel indignation that he by whom
this was secured is dead? above all when the very same men
were the cause at once of his unpopularity and his untimely end.
You shall smart then, say they, since you dare to disapprove of
our deed. What unheard of insolence! One man then may
boast of a deed, which another is not even allowed to lament
without punishment. Why, even slaves have always been free
of this&mdash;&mdash;to feel their fears, their joys, their sorrows as their
own, and not at anybody else's dictation; and these are the very
things which now, at least according to what your "liberators"
have always in their mouths, they are trying to wrest from us
by terrorism. But they try in vain. There is no danger which
has terrors enough ever to make me desert the side of gratitude
or humanity; for never have I thought that death in a good
cause is to be shunned, often indeed that it deserves to be
courted. But why are they inclined to be enraged with me, if
my wishes are simply that they may come to regret their deed,
desiring as I do that C&aelig;sar's death may be felt to be untimely
by us all? It is my duty as a citizen to desire the preservation
of the constitution? Well, unless both my life in the past and
all my hopes for the future prove without any words of mine
that I do earnestly desire this, I make no demand to prove it
by my professions.</p>

<p>To you therefore I make a specially earnest appeal to let
facts come before assertions, and to take my word for it that, if
you feel that honesty is the best policy, it is impossible I should
have any association with lawless villains. Or can you believe
that the principles I pursued in the days of my youth, when
even error could pass with some excuse, I shall renounce now<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3716]</span>
that I am going down the hill, and with my own hands unravel
all the web of my life? That I will not do; nor yet will I commit
any act that could give offense, beyond the fact that I do
lament the sad fall of one who was to me the dearest friend
and the most illustrious of men. But were I otherwise disposed,
I would never deny what I was doing, lest it should be thought
I was at once shameless in doing wrong and false and cowardly
in dissembling it.</p>

<p>But then I undertook the management of those games which
C&aelig;sar's heir celebrated for C&aelig;sar's victory? Well, this is a matter
which belongs to one's private obligations, not to any political
arrangement; it was however in the first place a tribute of
respect which I was called upon to pay to the memory and the
eminent position of a man whom I dearly loved, even though he
was dead, and also one that I could not refuse at the request of
a young man so thoroughly promising, and so worthy in every
way of C&aelig;sar as he is.</p>

<p>Again, I have frequently paid visits of compliment to the consul
Antonius. And you will find that the very men who think
me but a lukewarm patriot are constantly going to his house
in crowds, actually for the purpose of soliciting or carrying away
some favor. But what a monstrous claim it is, that while C&aelig;sar
never laid any such embargo as this to prevent me from associating
freely with anybody I pleased,&mdash;&mdash;even if they were people
whom he personally did not like,&mdash;&mdash;these men who have robbed
me of my friend should attempt by malicious insinuations to
prevent my showing a kindness to whomsoever I will!</p>

<p>I have however no fear that the moderation of my life will
hereafter prove an insufficient defense against false insinuations,
and that even those who do not love me, because of my loyalty
to C&aelig;sar, would not rather have their own friend imitate me
than themselves. Such of life as remains to me, at least if I
succeed in what I desire, I shall spend in quiet at Rhodes; but
if I find that some chance has put a stop to this, I shall simply
live at Rome as one who is always desirous that right should be
done.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to our good friend Trebatius for having
thus disclosed to me your sincere and friendly feeling, and given
me even an additional reason for honoring and paying respect
to one whom it has always been a pleasure to me to regard as
a friend. Farewell heartily, and let me have your esteem.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DREAM_OF_SCIPIO" id="THE_DREAM_OF_SCIPIO"></a>THE DREAM OF SCIPIO</h3>

<h4>From the Dialogue (The Republic): Translation of Prof. T.R. Lounsbury</h4>


<p>When I went into Africa with the consul Manius Manilius,
holding the rank, as you are aware, of military tribune
of the fourth legion, nothing lay nearer to my heart than
to meet Masinissa, a king who, for good reasons, was on the
most friendly terms with our family. When I had come to him,
the old man embraced me with tears, and then looking up to
heaven, said:&mdash;&mdash;"I give thanks to thee, O supremest Sol, and to
you, ye inhabitants of heaven! that before I depart this life I
behold in my dominions, and under this roof, Publius Cornelius
Scipio, by whose very name I am revived: so never passes away
from my mind the memory of that best and most invincible hero."
Thereupon I made inquiries of him as to the state of his own
kingdom, and he of me as to our republic; and with many words
uttered on both sides, we spent the whole of that day.</p>

<p>Moreover, after partaking of a repast prepared with royal
magnificence, we prolonged the conversation late into the night.
The old man would speak of nothing but Africanus, and remembered
not only all his deeds, but likewise his sayings. After
we parted to go to bed, a sounder sleep than usual fell upon
me, partly on account of weariness occasioned by the journey,
and partly because I had stayed up to a late hour. Then Africanus
appeared to me, I think in consequence of what we had
been talking about; for it often happens that our thoughts and
speeches bring about in sleep something of that illusion of which
Ennius writes in regard to himself and Homer, of which poet
he was very often accustomed to think and speak while awake.
Africanus showed himself to me in that form which was better
known to me from his ancestral image than from my recollection
of his person. As soon as I recognized him I was seized with
a fit of terror; but he thereupon said:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be of good courage, O Scipio! Lay aside fear, and commit
to memory these things which I am about to say. Do you see
that State which, compelled by me to submit to the Roman
people, renews its former wars, and cannot endure to remain at
peace?" At these words, from a certain lustrous and bright
place, very high and full of stars, he pointed out to me Carthage.
"To fight against that city thou now comest in a rank but little
above that of a private soldier; but in two years from this time<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3718]</span>
thou shalt as consul utterly overthrow it, and in consequence
shalt gain by thy own exertions that very surname of Africanus
which up to this time thou hast inherited from us. But when
thou shalt have destroyed Carthage, shalt have had the honor of
a triumph, and shalt have been censor, thou shalt during thy
absence be chosen consul for a second time, shalt put an end to
to a great war, and lay Numantia in ruins. But when thou
shalt be carried in thy triumphal chariot to the capitol, thou
wilt find the republic disturbed by the designs of my grandson.
Then, O Scipio! it will be necessary that thou exhibit the purity
and greatness of thy heart, thy soul, and thy judgment. But
I see at that time a double way disclose itself, as if the Fates
were undecided; for when thy life shall have completed eight
times seven revolutions of the sun, and these two numbers (each
one of which is looked upon as perfect; the one for one reason,
the other for another) shall have accomplished for thee by
their natural revolution the fatal product, to thee alone and
to thy name the whole State shall turn; upon thee the Senate,
upon thee all good men, upon thee the allies, upon thee the
Latins, will fasten their eyes; thou wilt be the one upon whom
the safety of the State shall rest; and in short, as dictator, it
will be incumbent on thee to establish and regulate the republic,
if thou art successful in escaping the impious hands of kinsmen."</p>

<p>At this point, L&aelig;lius uttered an exclamation of sorrow, and
the rest groaned more deeply; but Scipio, slightly smiling, said,
Keep silence, I beg of you. Do not awake me from my dream,
and hear the rest of his words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, O Africanus! that thou mayest be the more zealous in
the defense of the republic, know this: For all who have preserved,
who have succored, who have aggrandized their country,
there is in heaven a certain fixed place, where they enjoy an
eternal life of blessedness. For to that highest God who governs
the whole world there is nothing which can be done on
earth more dear than those combinations of men and unions,
made under the sanction of law, which are called States. The
rulers and preservers of them depart from this place, and to it
they return."</p>

<p>I had been filled with terror, not so much at the fear of
death as at the prospect of treachery on the part of those akin
to me; nevertheless at this point I had the courage to ask
whether my father Paulus was living, and others whom we<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3719]</span>
thought to be annihilated. "Certainly," said he: "they alone
live who have been set free from the fetters of the body, as if
from prison; for that which you call your life is nothing but
death. Nay, thou mayest even behold thy father Paulus coming
towards thee."</p>

<p>No sooner had I seen him than I burst into a violent fit of
tears; but he thereupon, embracing and kissing me, forbade my
weeping. I, as soon as I had checked my tears and was able
again to speak, said to him, "Tell me, I beseech thee, O best
and most sacred father! since this is life, as I hear Africanus
say, why do I tarry upon earth? Why shall I not hasten to go to
you?"&mdash;"Not so," said he; "not until that God, whose temple
is all this which thou seest, shall have freed thee from the
bonds of the body, can any entrance lie open to thee here.
For men are brought into the world with this design, that they
may protect and preserve that globe which thou seest in the
middle of this temple, and which is called 'Earth.' To them a
soul is given from these everlasting fires which you name constellations
and stars, which, in the form of globes and spheres,
run with incredible rapidity the rounds of their orbits under the
impulse of divine intelligences. Wherefore by thee, O Publius!
and by all pious men, the soul must be kept in the guardianship
of the body; nor without the command of Him by whom it is
given to you can there be any departure from this mortal life,
lest you seem to have shunned the discharge of that duty as
men which has been assigned to you by God. But, O Scipio!
like as thy grandfather who stands here, like as I who gave
thee life, cherish the sense of justice and loyal affection; which
latter, in however great measure due to thy parents and kinsmen,
is most of all due to thy country. Such a life is the way
to heaven, and to that congregation of those who have ended
their days on earth, and freed from the body, dwell in that
place which you see,&mdash;that place which, as you have learned
from the Greeks, you are in the habit of calling the Milky Way."</p>

<p>This was a circle, shining among the celestial fires with a
most brilliant whiteness. As I looked from it, all other things
seemed magnificent and wonderful. Moreover, they were such
stars as we have never seen from this point of space, and all of
such magnitude as we have never even suspected. Among them,
that was the least which, the farthest from heaven, and the
nearest to earth, shone with a borrowed light. But the starry
globes far exceeded the size of the earth: indeed the earth<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3720]</span>
itself appeared to me so small that I had a feeling of mortification
at the sight of our empire, which took up what seemed to
be but a point of it.</p>

<p>As I kept my eyes more intently fixed upon this spot, Africanus
said to me:&mdash;"How long, I beg of thee, will thy spirit be
chained down to earth? Seest thou not into what a holy place
thou hast come? Everything is bound together in nine circles,
or rather spheres, of which the farthest is the firmament, which
embraces the rest, is indeed the supreme God himself, confining
and containing all the others. To that highest heaven are fixed
those orbits of the stars which eternally revolve. Below it are
seven spheres, which move backward with a motion contrary to
that of the firmament. One of these belongs to that star which
on earth they call Saturn; then follows that shining orb, the
source of happiness and health to the human race, which is
called Jupiter; then the red planet, bringing terror to the nations,
to which you give the name of Mars; then, almost directly under
the middle region, stands the sun,&mdash;the leader, the chief,
the governor of the other luminaries, the soul of the universe,
and its regulating principle, of a size so vast that it penetrates
and fills everything with its own light.  Upon it, as if they
were an escort, follow two spheres,&mdash;the one of Venus, the other
of Mercury; and in the lowest circle revolves the moon, illuminated
by the rays of the sun. Below it there is nothing which is
not mortal and transitory, save the souls which are given to
mankind by the gift of the gods; above the moon, all things are
eternal. For that ninth sphere, which is in the middle, is the
earth: it has no motion; it is the lowest in space; and all heavy
bodies are borne toward it by their natural downward tendency."</p>

<p>I looked at these, lost in wonder. As soon as I had recovered
myself I said, "What is this sound, so great and so sweet,
which fills my ears?"&mdash;"This," he replied, "is that music
which, composed of intervals unequal, but divided proportionately
by rule, is caused by the swing and movement of the spheres
themselves, and by the proper combination of acute tones with
grave, creates with uniformity manifold and diverse harmonies.
For movements so mighty cannot be accomplished in silence;
and it is a law of nature that the farthest sphere on the one
side gives forth a base tone, the farthest on the other a treble;
for which reason the revolution of that uppermost arch of the
heaven, the starry firmament, whose motion is more rapid, is
attended with an acute and high sound; while that of the lowest,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3721]</span>
or lunar arch, is attended with a very deep and grave sound.
For the ninth sphere, the earth, embracing the middle region of
the universe, stays immovably in one fixed place. But those
eight globes between, two<a name="FNanchor_A_425" id="FNanchor_A_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_425" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of which have the same essential
action, produce tones, distinguished by intervals, to the number
of seven; which number indeed is the knot of almost all things.
Men of skill, by imitating the result on the strings of the lyre,
or by means of the human voice, have laid open for themselves
a way of return to this place, just as other men of lofty souls
have done the same by devoting themselves during their earthly
life to the study of what is divine. But the ears of men, surfeited
by this harmony have become deaf to it; nor is there in
you any duller sense: just as, at that cataract which is called
Catadupa,&mdash;where the Nile rushes down headlong from the lofty
mountain-tops,&mdash;the people who dwell in that neighborhood have
lost the sense of hearing in consequence of the magnitude of the
sound. So likewise this harmony, produced by the excessively
rapid revolution of the whole universe, is so great that the ears
of men are not able to take it in, in the same manner as you are
not able to look the sun in the eye, and your sight is overcome
by the power of its rays." Though I was filled with wonder,
nevertheless I kept turning my eyes from time to time to the
earth.</p>

<p>"I perceive," then said Africanus, "that thou still continuest
to contemplate the habitation of the home of man. If that seems
to thee as small as it really is, keep then thy eyes fixed on
these heavenly objects; look with contempt on those of mortal
life. For what notoriety that lives in the mouths of men, or
what glory that is worthy of being sought after, art thou able
to secure? Thou seest that the earth is inhabited in a few small
localities, and that between those inhabited places&mdash;spots as it
were on the surface&mdash;vast desert regions lie spread out; and
that those who inhabit the earth are not only so isolated that no
communication can pass among them from one to another, but
that some dwell in an oblique direction as regards you, some in
a diagonal, and some stand even exactly opposite you. From
these you are certainly not able to hope for any glory.</p>

<p>"Moreover, thou observest that this same earth is surrounded,
and as it were, girdled, by certain zones, of which thou seest
that two&mdash;the farthest apart, and resting at both sides on the
very poles of the sky&mdash;are stiffened with frost; and that, again,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3722]</span>
the central and largest one is burnt up with the heat of the sun.
Two are habitable: of these the southern one, in which dwell
those who make their footprints opposite yours, is a foreign
world to your race. But even this other one, which lies to the
north, which you occupy,&mdash;see with how small a part of it you
come into contact! For all the land which is cultivated by you,
very narrow at the extremities but wider at the sides, is only a
small island surrounded by that water which on earth you call
the Atlantic, or the great sea, or the ocean. But though its
name is so high-sounding, yet thou beholdest how small it is.
From these cultivated and well-known regions can either thy
name or the name of any of us surmount and pass this Caucasus
which thou seest, or cross yonder flood of the Ganges?
Who in the farthest remaining regions of the rising and the
setting sun, or on the confines of the north and the south, will
hear thy name? When these are taken away, thou assuredly
perceivest how immense is the littleness of that space in which
your reputation seeks to spread itself abroad. Moreover, even
those who speak of us, for how long a time will they speak?</p>

<p>"Nay, even if the generations of men were desirous, one
after the other, to hand down to posterity the praises of any one
of us heard from their fathers, nevertheless, on account of the
changes in the earth,&mdash;wrought by inundations and conflagration,
which are sure to recur at certain fixed epochs,&mdash;we are
not simply unable to secure for ourselves a glory which lasts
forever, but are even unable to gain a glory which lasts for a
long time. Moreover, of what value is it that the speech of
those who are to be born hereafter shall be about thee, when
nothing has been said of thee by all those who were born before,
who were neither fewer in number and were unquestionably
better men; especially when no one is able to live in the memory
of those very persons by whom one's name can be heard, for
the space of one year?</p>

<p>"For men commonly measure the year by the return to its
place of the sun alone, that is, of one star; but when all the
stars shall have returned to that same point from which they
once set out, and after a long period of time have brought back
the same relative arrangement of the whole heaven, that, then,
can justly be called the complete year. In it I hardly dare say
how many ages of human life are contained. For once in the
past the sun seemed to disappear from the eyes of men and to
be annihilated, at the time when the soul of Romulus made its<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3723]</span>
way into this very temple. When, from the same region of the
sky and at the same moment of time, the sun shall have again
vanished, then be sure that all constellations and stars have
come back to the position they had in the beginning, and that
the perfect year is completed. Of that year know that now not
even the twentieth part has passed.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, if thou givest up the hope of a return to this
place, in which all things exist for lofty and pre-eminent souls,
yet of how much value is that human glory which can hardly
endure for even the small part of a single year? But if, as I
was saying, thou wishest to look on high, and to fix thy gaze
upon this abode of the blest and this eternal home, never give
thyself up to the applause of the vulgar, nor rest the recompense
of thy achievements in the rewards which can be bestowed
upon thee by men. It is incumbent on thee that Virtue herself
shall draw thee by her own charm to true glory. As for the
way in which others talk about thee, let them take care of
that themselves; yet without doubt they will talk. But all such
renown is limited to the petty provinces of the regions which
thou seest: nor in the case of any one is it everlasting; for it
both dies with the death of men and is buried in oblivion by
the forgetfulness of posterity."</p>

<p>When he had said these things, "O Africanus!" I replied, "if
the path that leads to the entrance of heaven lies open to those
who have rendered great service to their country, although, in
following from my boyhood in thy footsteps and in those of my
father, I have not failed in sustaining the honor derived from
you, yet henceforth I shall toil with far more zeal, now that so
great a reward has been held out before me."&mdash;"Do thou
indeed," said he, "continue to strive; and bear this in mind,
that thou thyself art not mortal, but this body of thine. For
thou art not the one which that form of thine proclaims thee to
be: but the soul of any one, that alone is he; not that external
shape which can be pointed out with the finger. Therefore
know thyself to be a god, if that is essentially god which lives,
which feels, which remembers, which foresees, which rules and
regulates and moves that body over which it is put in authority,
as the Supreme Being governs this universe. And as the eternal
God moves the world, which in a certain point of view is
perishable, so the incorruptible soul moves the corruptible
body. For what always moves itself is eternal; but that which<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3724]</span>
communicates to anything a motion which it has itself received
from another source, must necessarily have an end of life when
it has an end of motion: therefore that alone never ceases to
move which moves itself, for the reason that it is never deserted
by itself. This indeed is the well-head; this the beginning of
motion to all other things that are moved. But to a beginning
there is no birth; for all things are born from the beginning.
But it itself cannot be born of anything; for that would not be
a beginning which sprang from some other source. And just
as it is never begotten, so it never dies; for a beginning annihilated
could neither itself be brought back to life by anything
else, nor could it create anything else out of itself, since it is
necessary that all things should come from a beginning. So it
results that the beginning of motion is in itself, because it is
self-moved. And this can neither be born nor die, for if it did,
the heavens would fall to ruin, and all nature would stand still;
nor could it come into the possession of any power by the
original impulse of which it might be put into motion.</p>

<p>"Since therefore it is clear that what is self-moved is eternal,
who can deny that this essential characteristic has been
imparted to the soul? For everything which is moved by a
foreign impulse is without a soul; but that which lives is made
to go by an inward motion of its own, for this is the special
nature and power of the soul. But if it is the one thing among
all which is self-moved, then certainly it has had no beginning,
and is eternal. Do thou, then, employ it in the noblest duties.
But those are the loftiest cares which are concerned with the
well-being of our native land. The soul that is inspired by
these, and occupied with them, will hasten the quicker into this
its real home and habitation. So much the more speedily indeed
will it do this, if while it is shut up in the body it shall pass
beyond its limits, and by the contemplation of those things
which are outside of it shall withdraw itself as far as possible
from the body. For the souls of those who have given themselves
up to sensual pleasures, and have made themselves as it
were ministers to these, and who under the pressure of desires
which are subservient to these pleasures have violated the laws
of God and man, when they shall have parted from the body,
will fly about the earth itself, nor will return to this place until
they shall have suffered torments for many ages." He departed.
I awoke from my sleep.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CID" id="THE_CID"></a>THE CID</h2>

<h4>(1045?-1099)</h4>

<h4>BY CHARLES SPRAGUE SMITH</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capi.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">n the Cid we have two distinct personages, Rodrigo or Ruy
Diaz (Dia son of Diego) who flourished during the last half
of the eleventh century; and that legendary hero of Spanish
epic poems, ballads, and dramas, whom Philip II. tried to have canonized.
We are not left to our own conjectures as to the character
and life of the historical Cid. Both Spanish and Arabic records
place the main facts beyond all controversy.</p>

<p>He was born at Bivar, a hamlet three miles north of Burgos
(circa 1040-1050), of an ancient Castilian family claiming descent from
Lain Calvo,&mdash;one of the two judges who, tradition declares, was
named by the Castilian people as their governor after the Leonese
king had treacherously put their counts to death (circa 923).</p>

<p>The period of the Cid coincides with the political disruption of
Arabic Spain. The Caliphate of Cordova, which in the preceding
century had attained its high point in power and in all the arts of
civilization, had fallen. A multitude of petty Moorish States disputed
with each other the heritage of the Ommiad caliphs. The Christian
States were not slow to profit by their opportunity. Ferdinand I. of
Leon-Castile (surnamed the Great, 1037-65) not only extended his
territory at the expense of the Moors, but also imposed tribute upon
four of their more important States&mdash;Saragossa, Toledo, Badajoz, and
Seville. Valencia only escaped a similar fate through his death.</p>

<p>The Peninsula was at this time divided among a large number of
mutually independent and warring States, Christian and Moslem.
The sentiments of loyalty to religion and to country were universally
subordinated to those of personal interest; Christians fought
under Moorish banners, Moors under Christian. Humanity toward
the enemy, loyalty to oaths, were not virtues in the common estimation.
Between the Christian States of Leon and Castile great
jealousy ruled. Castile had come into being as a border province of
the Asturian kingdom, governed by military counts. From the first
there seems to have been a spirit of resistance to the overrule of the
Asturian kings (later known as kings of Leon). Finally, under its
Count Fernan Gonzalez (who died 970), Castile secured its independence.
But whether leading a separate political existence, or united
with Leon, Castile was ever jealously sensitive of any precedence<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3726]</span>
claimed or exercised by its sister kingdom. Ferdinand I. of Leon-Castile,
treating his territorial possessions as personal property,&mdash;a
policy repeatedly fatal to all advance in Spanish history,&mdash;divided
them at his death (1005), among his five children. Sancho, the
eldest, received Castile, Nahera, and Pampeluna; Alfonso, Leon, and
the Asturias; Garcia, Galicia, and that portion of Portugal which
had been wrested from the Moors; Urraca received the city of
Zamora; and Elvira, Toro.</p>

<p>The expected occurred. Sancho made war on his brothers, compelling
both to flee to Moorish territories, and wrested Toro from
Elvira. Rodrigo Diaz, the Cid, appears first at this period. He is
the <i>alferez, i.e.</i>, the standard-bearer, or commander-in-chief under the
King, in Sancho's army. The brother Kings, Sancho and Alfonso,
had agreed to submit their dispute to a single combat, the victor to
receive the territories of both. Alfonso's Leonese army conquered
the Castilian, and relying upon the agreement withdrew to its tents.
Rodrigo Diaz was already known as the Campeador, a title won
through his having, vanquished in single combat the champion of
Sancho of Navarre, and signifying probably one skilled in battle, or
champion.</p>

<p>Rodrigo gave a wily counsel to the routed Castilians. "The
Leonese are not expecting an attack," he said; "let us return and
fall upon them at unawares." The counsel was followed; the victors,
resting in their tents, were surprised at daybreak, and only a few,
Alfonso among the number, escaped with their lives. Alfonso was
imprisoned at Burgos, but soon released at the entreaty of the Princess
Urraca, on condition of his becoming a monk. Availing himself
of such liberty, he escaped from the monastery to the Moorish court
of Mamoun, King of Toledo. Sancho ruled thus over the entire
heritage of his father,&mdash;Zamora excepted, the portion of Urraca.
While laying siege to that city, he was slain by a cavalier in
Urraca's service, Bellido Dolfos, who, sallying from the city, made
good his escape, though almost overtaken by the avenging Campeador,
1072.</p>

<p>Alfonso, the fugitive at Toledo, was now rightful heir to the
throne; and however reluctant the Castilian nobles were to recognize
the authority of a Leonese king, they yielded to necessity. It
is asserted&mdash;but the historical evidence here is not complete&mdash;that
before recognizing Alfonso's authority the Castilian nobles required
of him an oath that he had no part in his brother's murder, and that
it was the Campeador who administered this oath, 1073. Whatever
the facts, Alfonso will have thought it wise to conciliate the good-will
of the Castilian grandees, and especially that of their leader
Rodrigo, until at least his own position became secure. To this we<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3727]</span>
may attribute his giving to Rodrigo in marriage of Jimena, daughter
of Diego, Count of Oviedo, and first cousin of the King. The marriage
contract, bearing date 1074, is preserved at Burgos.</p>

<p>Some years later Rodrigo was sent to collect the tribute due
Alfonso by his vassal Motamid, King of Seville. Finding the King
of Granada at war with Motamid, Rodrigo requested him not to
attack an ally of Alfonso. But prayers and threats were alike unavailing;
it came to battle, and Rodrigo conquered. Among the prisoners
were several Christians in the service of Granada, notably
Garcia Ordonez, a scion of the royal Leonese house. Not long after,
we find Rodrigo charged with having appropriated to his own use a
portion of the tribute and gifts sent to Alfonso by Motamid, Garcia
Ordonez being his chief accuser. Taking advantage of the pretext&mdash;it
can have been but a pretext&mdash;of Rodrigo's attacking the Moors
without first securing the royal consent, Alfonso banished him. Old
wrongs still rankling in the King's memory furnished probably the
real motive.</p>

<p>And now began that career as soldier of fortune which has furnished
themes to Spanish poets of high and low degree, and which,
transformed and idealized by tradition, has made of Rodrigo the perfect
cavalier of crusading Christian Spain. He offered first, it would
seem, his service and that of his followers to the Christian Count of
Barcelona, and when refused by him, to the Moorish King of Saragossa.
This State was one of the more important of those resulting
from the distribution of the Caliphate of Cordova. The offer was
accepted, and Rodrigo remained here until 1088, serving successively
three generations of the Beni-Hud, father, son, and grandson, warring
indifferently against Christians and Moors, and through his successes
rising to extraordinary distinction and power.</p>

<p>At this time&mdash;1088&mdash;the attention of both Mostain, the King of
Saragossa, and of his powerful captain Rodrigo, was drawn to Valencia.
This city after the fall of the Caliphate of Cordova had been
ruled for forty-four years by descendants of Almanzor, the great
Prime Minister of the last period of the Ommiad dynasty. Mamoun,
King of Toledo, who sheltered the fugitive Alfonso, deposed the last
of these Valencian kings, his son-in-law, and annexed the State to his
own dominion. At Mamoun's death in 1075 Valencia revolted; the
governor declared himself independent and placed himself under
Alfonso's protection.</p>

<p>Ten years later Mamoun's successor, the weak Cadir, finding his
position a desperate one, offered to yield up to Alfonso his own capital
Toledo, on condition that the latter should place Valencia in his
hands. Alfonso consented. Valencia was too weak to offer resistance,
but Cadir proved equally incompetent as king and as general.
Depending entirely upon his Castilian soldiery, captained by Alvar<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3728]</span>
Fa&ntilde;ez, a kinsman of Rodrigo, he grievously burdened the people in
order to satisfy the demands of this auxiliary troop. But grinding
taxes and extortions alike failed; and the soldiery, their wages in
arrears, battened upon the country, the dregs of the Moorish population
joining them. The territory was delivered at last from their
robberies, rapes, and murders, by the appearance of the Almoravides.
This new Moslem sect had grown strong in Africa, attaining there
the political supremacy; and in their weakness the Moorish kings
of Spain implored its assistance in repelling the attacks of the
Christian North.</p>

<p>King Alfonso, alarmed at the appearance of these African hordes,
recalled Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez, was defeated by the Almoravides at Zallaca
in 1086, and could think no more of garrisoning Valencia for Cadir.
The position of Cadir became thus critical, and he appealed for help
both to Alfonso and to Mostain of Saragossa. Mostain sent Rodrigo,
ostensibly to his assistance; but a secret agreement had been made,
Arabic historians assert, between the king and his general, whereby
Cadir was to be despoiled, the city fall to Mostain, the booty to
Rodrigo (1088).</p>

<p>The expedition was a successful one: Cadir's enemies were compelled
to withdraw, and Rodrigo established himself in Valencian
territory. As the recognized protector of the lawful king, in reality
the suzerain of Valencia, Rodrigo received a generous tribute; but
he had no intention of holding to his agreement with Mostain and
assisting the latter to win the city. It is clear on the contrary that
he had already resolved to secure, when opportunity offered, the
prize for himself. Meanwhile he skillfully held off, now by force,
now by ruse, all other competitors, Christian and Moslem alike;
including among these King Alfonso, whose territories he wasted
with fire and sword when that monarch attempted once, in Rodrigo's
absence, to win Valencia for himself.</p>

<p>At another time we find him intriguing simultaneously with four
different rivals for the control of the city,&mdash;Alfonso and Mostain
among the number,&mdash;deceiving all with fair words.</p>

<p>As head of an independent army, Rodrigo made now successful
forays in all directions; despoiling, levying tribute, garrisoning
strongholds, strengthening thus in every way his position. At last
the long awaited opportunity came. During his temporary absence,
Cadir was dethroned and put to death; and the leader of the insurgents,
the Cadi Ibn Djahhof, named president of a republic.</p>

<p>Rodrigo returned, and appealing in turn to ruse and force, at last
sat down before the city to reduce it by famine. During the last
period of the siege, those who fled from the city to escape the
famine were thrown to dogs, or burned at slow fires. The city
capitulated on favorable terms, June 15th, 1094. But all the conditions<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3729]</span>
of the capitulation were violated. The Cadi-President was buried in
a trench up to his arm-pits, surrounded with burning brands, and
slowly tortured to death, several of his kinsmen and friends sharing
his fate. Rodrigo was with difficulty restrained from throwing into
the flames the Cadi's children and the women of his harem. Yet
the lives and property of Ibn Djahhof and his family had been
expressly safeguarded in the capitulation. It is probable that Rodrigo's
title of "the Cid" or "my Cid" (Arabic, Sid-y = my lord) was
given to him at this time by his Moorish subjects.</p>

<p>Master of Valencia, the Cid dreamed of conquering all that region
of Spain still held by the Moors. An Arab heard him say, "One
Rodrigo (the last king of the Goths) has lost this peninsula; another
Rodrigo will recover it." Success crowned his arms for several
years. But in 1099 the troops he had sent against the Almoravides
were utterly routed, few escaping. The Cid, already enfeebled in
health, died, it is said of grief and shame (July, 1099). His widow
held the city for two years longer. Besieged at that time by the
Almoravides, she sought help of Alfonso. He came and forced the
enemy to raise the siege; but judging that it was not possible for
him to defend a city so remote from his dominions, counseled its
abandonment. As the Christians, escorting the body of the Cid,
marched out, Valencia was fired; and only ruins awaited the Almoravides
(1102).</p>

<p>The Cid's body was brought to San Pedro de Carde&ntilde;a, a monastery
not far from Burgos; enthroned, it is said, beside the high altar
for ten years, and thereafter buried. Jimena survived her husband
until 1104.</p>

<p>Ibn Bassam, an Arabic contemporary, writing at Seville only ten
years after the death of the Cid, after describing his cruelty and
duplicity, adds:&mdash;"Nevertheless, that man, the scourge of his time,
was one of the miracles of the Lord in his love of glory, the prudent
firmness of his character, and his heroic courage. Victory always
followed the banner of Rodrigo (may God curse him!); he triumphed
over the barbarians, ... he put to flight their armies, and with
his little band of warriors slew their numerous soldiery."</p>

<p>The Cid, a man not of princely birth, through the exercise of virtues
which his time esteemed,&mdash;courage and shrewdness,&mdash;had won
for himself from the Moors an independent principality. Legend will
have begun to color and transform his exploits already during his
lifetime. Some fifty years later he had become the favorite hero of
popular songs. It is probable that these songs (<i>cantares</i>) were at first
brief tales in rude metrical form; and that the epic poems, dating
from about 1200, used them as sources. The earliest poetic monument
in Castilian literature which treats of the Cid is called 'The<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3730]</span>
Poem of My Cid.' While based upon history, its material is largely
legendary. The date of its composition is doubtful,&mdash;probably about
1200. The poem&mdash;the beginning is lost&mdash;opens with the departure
of "My Cid" from Bivar, and describes his Moorish campaigns, culminating
with the conquest of Valencia. Two Leonese nobles, the
Infantes (Princes) of Carrion, beseech Alfonso to ask for them in
marriage the conqueror's daughters. The Cid assents&mdash;to his King
he would refuse nothing&mdash;and the marriages are celebrated in Valencia
with due pomp. But the princes are arrant cowards. To
escape the gibes of the Cid's companions, after securing rich wedding
portions they depart for Carrion. In the oak wood of Carpes
they pretend a desire to be left alone with their wives. Despoiling
them of their outer garments, with saddle-girth and spurred boot
they seek to revenge upon the Cid's daughters the dishonor to which
their own base conduct subjected them while at the Cid's court.
But time brings a requital. The Infantes, called to account, forfeit
property and honor, esteeming themselves fortunate to escape with
their lives from the judicial duels. Princes of Navarre and Aragon
present themselves as suitors, and in second marriages Do&ntilde;a Elvira
and Do&ntilde;a Sola become queens of Spain. The marriages with the
Infantes of Carrion are pure invention, intended perhaps to defame
the Leonese nobility, these nobles being princes of the blood royal.</p>

<p>The second marriages, if we substitute Barcelona for Aragon, are
historical. Of the Cid's two daughters, one married Prince Ramiro
of Navarre and the other Count Raynard Berenger III. of Barcelona.
In 1157 two of the Cid's great-grandchildren, Sancho VI. of Navarre
and his sister Do&ntilde;a Blanca, queen of Sancho III. of Castile, sat on
Spanish thrones. Through intermarriage the blood of the Cid has
passed into the Bourbon and Habsburg lines, and with Eleanor of
Castile into the English royal house.</p>

<p>The 'Poem of My Cid' is probably the earliest monument of
Spanish literature. It is also in our opinion the noblest expression&mdash;so
far as the characters are concerned; for the verse halts and
the description sometimes lags&mdash;of the entire medi&aelig;val folk epic of
Europe. Homeric in its simplicity, its characters are drawn with
clearness, firmness, and concision, presenting a variety true to nature,
far different from the uniformity we find in the 'Song of Roland.'
The spirit which breathes in it is of a noble, well-rounded humanity,
a fearless and gentle courage, a manly and modest self-reliance; an
unswerving loyalty and simple trust toward country, king, kinsmen,
and friends; a child-faith in God, slightly tinged with superstition, for
"My Cid" believes in auguries; and a chaste tender family affection,
where the wife is loved and honored as wife and as mother, and the
children's welfare fills the father's thoughts.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3731]</span></p>

<p>The duplicity of the historical Cid has left indeed its traces.
When abandoning Castile he sends to two Jewish money-lenders of
Burgos, chests filled, as he pretends, with fine gold, but in reality
with sand; borrows upon this security, and so far as we are informed,
never repays the loan. The Princes of Carrion, his sons-in-law, are
duped into thinking that they will escape from the accounting with
the loss of Tizon and Colada, the swords which the Cid gave them.
But a certain measure of prudent shrewdness is not out of place in
dealing with men of the treacherous character of the Infantes. And
as to the Jewish money-lenders, to despoil them would scarce have
been regarded as an offense against the moral law in medi&aelig;val Spain.</p>

<p>The second poetic monument is variously named. Amadar de
los Rios, a historian of Spanish literature, styles it 'The Legend or
Chronicle of the Youth of Rodrigo.' Its date also is disputed, some
authorities placing its composition earlier, others later than that of
the Poem. The weight of evidence seems to us in favor of the later
date. It is rude and of inferior merit, though not without vigorous
passages. It treats the earliest period of the Cid's life, and is (so far
as we know) purely legendary. The realm of Castile-Leon is at peace
under the rule of Ferdinand (the First), when the Count Don Gomez of
Gormaz makes an unprovoked descent upon the sheep-folds of Diego
Lainez. A challenge of battle follows. Rodrigo, only son of Diego,
a lad in his thirteenth year, insists upon being one of the hundred
combatants on the side of his family, and slays Don Gomez in single
combat. Jimena, the daughter of Gomez, implores justice of the
King; but when Ferdinand declares that there is danger of an insurrection
if Rodrigo be punished, she proposes reconciliation through
marriage. Diego and his son are summoned to the court, where
Rodrigo's appearance and conduct terrify all. He denies vassalship,
and declares to King Ferdinand, "That my father kissed your hand
has foully dishonored me."</p>

<p>Married to Jimena against his will (Jimena Diaz, not Jimena
Gomez, was his historical wife), he vows never to recognize her as
wife until he has won five battles with the Moors in open field.
Ferdinand plays a very unkingly r&ocirc;le in this poem. While his fierce
vassal is absent the King is helpless; and Rodrigo draws near only
to assert anew his contempt for the royal authority by blunt refusals
of Ferdinand's requests. He is always ready, however, to take up
the gauntlet and defend the realm against every enemy, Christian or
Moor. But this rude courage is coupled with devout piety, and is
not insensible to pity. At the ford of the Duero a wretched leper is
encountered: all turn from him with loathing save Rodrigo, who
gives to him a brother's care. It is Saint Lazarus, who departing
blesses him.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3732]</span></p>

<p>At last a formidable coalition is formed against Spain. The
Emperor of Germany and the King of France, supported by the Pope
and Patriarch, require of Spain, in recognition of her feudal dependence
upon the Roman empire, a yearly tribute of fifteen noble
virgins, besides silver, horses, falcons, etc. Rodrigo appears when
Ferdinand is in despair, and kisses at last the royal hand in sign of
vassalship. Though the enemy gather "countless as the herbs of the
fields," even Persia and Armenia furnishing contingents, their battle
array is vain.</p>

<p>The five Kings of Spain cross the Pyrenees. Arrived before Paris,
Rodrigo passes through the midst of the French army, strikes with
his hand the gates of the city, and challenges the twelve French
peers to combat. The allies in alarm implore a truce. At the
council, Rodrigo, seated at the feet of his King and acting as
Ferdinand's spokesman, curses the Pope when the latter offers the
imperial crown of Spain. "We came for that which was to be
won," he declares, "not for that already won." Against Rodrigo's
advice the truce is accorded to all. Here the poem is interrupted.</p>

<p>Besides these two epic poems, we have in the earlier Spanish
literature two chronicles in prose which describe the life of the Cid,&mdash;'The
General Chronicle of Alfonso the Learned' and 'The Chronicle
of the Cid,' the latter being drawn from the former. Both rest
in part upon historical sources, in part upon legend and tradition.
Two centuries and more after the Poem, we meet with the
Romances or Ballads of the Cid. For the earliest of these do not
in their present form date far back of 1500. These ballads derive
from all sources, but chiefly from the Cid legend, which is here
treated in a lyric, sentimental, popular, and at times even vulgar
tone.</p>

<p>Guillem de Castro (1569-1631) chose two themes from the life of
the Cid for dramatic treatment, composing a dual drama styled 'Las
Mocedades del Cid' (The Youth of the Cid). The first part is the
more important. De Castro, drawing from the ballads, told again
the story of the insult to Don Diego (according to the ballads, a
blow in the face given by Don Gomez in a moment of passion), its
revenge, the pursuit of Rodrigo by Jimena, demanding justice of
King Ferdinand, and finally the reconciliation through marriage.
But De Castro added love, and the conflict in the mind of Rodrigo
and in that of Jimena between affection and the claims of honor.</p>

<p>Corneille recast De Castro's first drama in his 'Le Cid,' condensing
it and giving to the verse greater dignity and nobility. The
French dramatist has worked with entire independence here, and
both in what he has omitted and what he has added has usually
shown an unerring dramatic instinct. In certain instances, however,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3733]</span>
through ignorance of the spirit and sources of the Spanish drama he
has erred. But the invention is wholly De Castro's, and many of
Corneille's most admired passages are either free translations from
the Spanish or expressions of some thought or sentiment contained
in De Castro's version.</p>

<p>In more recent times Herder has enriched German literature with
free renderings of some of the Cid ballads. Victor Hugo has drawn
from the Cid theme, in his 'La Legende des Si&egrave;cles' (The Legend of
the Centuries), fresh inspiration for his muse.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With tearful eyes he turned to gaze upon the wreck behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rifled coffers, bursten gates, all open to the wind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mantle left, nor robe of fur; stript bare his castle hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hawk nor falcon in the mew, the perches empty all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then forth in sorrow went my Cid, and a deep sigh sighed he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with a measured voice and calm, my Cid spake loftily,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I thank thee, God our Father, thou that dwellest upon high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I suffer cruel wrong to-day, but of mine enemy!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they came riding from Bivar the crow was on the right;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Burgos's gate, upon the left, the crow was there in sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Cid he shrugged his shoulders and he lifted up his head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Good tidings, Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez! we are banished men!" he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sixty lances in his train my Cid rode up the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The burghers and their dames from all the windows looking down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there were tears in every eye, and on each lip one word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A worthy vassal&mdash;would to God he served a worthy Lord!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The prayer was said, the mass was sung, they mounted to depart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Cid a moment stayed to press Jimena to his heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jimena kissed his hand,&mdash;as one distraught with grief was she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked upon his daughters: "These to God I leave," said he....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the finger-nail from out the flesh is torn away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so sharp to him and them the parting pang that day.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then cried my Cid&mdash;"In charity, as to the rescue&mdash;ho!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bucklers braced before their breasts, with lances pointing low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stooping crests and heads bent down above the saddle-bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All firm of hand and high of heart they roll upon the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that in a good hour was born, his clarion voice rings out,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Among them, gentlemen! Strike home for the love of charity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The champion of Bivar is here&mdash;Ruy Diaz&mdash;I am he!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bearing where Bermuez still maintains unequal fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three hundred lances down they come, their pennons flickering white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down go three hundred Moors to earth, a man to every blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they wheel, three hundred more, as charging back they go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a sight to see the lances rise and fall that day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shivered shields and riven mail, to see how thick they lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pennons that went in snow-white came out gory red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horses running riderless, the riders lying dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Moors call on Mohammed, and "Saint James!" the Christians cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sixty score of Moors and more in narrow compass lie.<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Scene from the challenges that preceded the judicial duels. Ferrando,

<span class="i0">"Now is the time, 'Dumb Peter'; speak. O man that sittest mute!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My daughters' and thy cousins' name and fame are in dispute:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me they speak, to thee they look to answer every word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I am left to answer now, thou canst not draw thy sword."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tongue-tied Bermuez stood; a while he strove for words in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But look you, when he once began he made his meaning plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Cid, first I have a word for you: you always are the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Cortes ever gibing me,&mdash;'Dumb Peter' is the name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It never was a gift of mine, and that long since you knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But have you found me fail in aught that fell to me to do?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You lie, Ferrando, lie in all you say upon that score.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The honor was to you, not him, the Cid Campeador;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I know something of your worth, and somewhat I can tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day beneath Valencia wall&mdash;you recollect it well&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You prayed the Cid to place you in the forefront of the fray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You spied a Moor, and valiantly you went that Moor to slay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then you turned and fled&mdash;for his approach you would not stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right soon he would have taught you 'twas a sorry game to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I not been in battle there to take your place that day.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3735]</span><span class="i0">I slew him at the first onfall; I gave his steed to you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To no man have I told the tale from that hour hitherto.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my Cid and all his men you got yourself a name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How you in single combat slew a Moor&mdash;a deed of fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all believed in your exploit; they wist not of your shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are a craven at the core,&mdash;tall, handsome, as you stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How dare you talk as now you talk, you tongue without a hand?...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now take thou my defiance as a traitor, trothless knight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this plea before our King Alfonso will I fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The daughters of my lord are wronged, their wrong is mine to right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye those ladies did desert, the baser are ye then;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what are they?&mdash;weak women; and what are ye?&mdash;strong men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every count I deem their cause to be the holier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will make thee own it when we meet in battle here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traitor thou shalt confess thyself, so help me God on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that I have said to-day my sword shall verify."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Thus far these two. Diego rose, and spoke as ye shall hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Counts by our birth are we, of stain our lineage is clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this alliance with my Cid there was no parity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we his daughters cast aside, no cause for shame we see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little need we care if they in mourning pass their lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enduring the reproach that clings to scorned rejected wives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In leaving them we but upheld our honor and our right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ready to the death am I, maintaining this, to fight."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Martin Antolinez sprang upon his feet: "False hound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you not silent keep that mouth where truth was never found?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you to boast! the lion scare have you forgotten too?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How through the open door you rushed, across the court-yard flew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sprawling in your terror on the wine-press beam you lay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay! never more, I trow, you wore the mantle of that day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no choice; the issue now the sword alone can try;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The daughters of my Cid ye spurned; that must ye justify.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every count I here declare their cause the cause of right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt own thy treachery the day we join in fight."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ceased, and striding up the hall Assur Gonzalez passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cheek was flushed with wine, for he had stayed to break his fast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ungirt his robe, and trailing low his ermine mantle hung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rude was his bearing to the court, and reckless was his tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What a to-do is here, my lords! was the like ever seen?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What talk is this about my Cid&mdash;him of Bivar I mean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Riodouirna let him go to take his millers' rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep his mills a-going there, as once he was content.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, forsooth, mate his daughters with the Counts of Carrion!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upstarted Mu&ntilde;o Gustioz: "False, foul-mouthed knave, have done!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No share in thy good-will I seek; one only boon I pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chance to make thee own thyself the villain that I say."<br /></span>

</div><p class="dropcap">he statesman first known as Mr. Hyde of the Inner Temple,
then as Sir Edward Hyde, and finally as the Earl of Clarendon,
belongs to the small but most valuable and eminent
band who have both made and written history; a group which
includes among others C&aelig;sar, Procopius, Sully, and Baber, and on a
smaller scale of active importance, Ammianus and Finlay. Born in
Dinton, Wiltshire, 1609, he was graduated at Oxford in 1626, and had
attained a high standing in his profession when the civil troubles
began, and he determined to devote all
his energies to his public duties in Parliament.
During the momentous period of
the Long Parliament he was strongly on
the side of the people until the old abuses
had been swept away; but he would not
go with them in paralyzing the royal authority
from distrust of Charles, and when
the civil war broke out he took the royal
side, accompanying the King to Oxford,
and remaining his ablest adviser and loyal
friend.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Earl of Clarendon</span></span>
</div>

<p>He was the guardian of Charles II. in
exile and in 1661, after the Restoration,
was made Lord Chancellor and chief minister.
Lord Macaulay says of him:&mdash;"He was well fitted for his
great place. No man wrote abler state papers. No man spoke with
more weight and dignity in council and Parliament. No man was
better acquainted with general maxims of statecraft. No man
observed the varieties of character with a more discriminating eye.
It must be added that he had a strong sense of moral and religious
obligation, a sincere reverence for the laws of his country, and a
conscientious regard for the honor and interest of the Crown." But
his faults were conspicuous. One of his critics insists that "his
temper was arbitrary and vehement. His arrogance was immeasurable.
His gravity assumed the character of censoriousness."</p>

<p>He took part in important and dangerous negotiations, and eventually
alienated four parties at once: the royalists by his Bill of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3738]</span>Indemnity; the low-churchmen and dissenters by his Uniformity act;
the many who suffered the legal fine for private assemblages for
religious worship; and the whole nation by selling Dunkirk to France.
By the court he was hated because he censured the extravagance and
looseness of the life led there; and finally Charles, who had long
resented his sermons, deprived him of the great seal, accused him
of high treason, and doomed him to perpetual banishment. Thus,
after being the confidential friend of two kings (and the future
grandfather of two sovereigns, Mary and Anne), he was driven out of
England, to die in poverty and neglect at Rouen in 1674. But these
last days were perhaps the happiest and most useful of his life.
He now indulged his master passion for literature, and revised his
'History of the Rebellion,' which he had begun while a fugitive from
the rebels in the Isle of Jersey. In this masterpiece, "one of the
greatest ornaments of the historical literature of England," he has
described not only the events in which he participated, but noted
people of the time whom he had personally known. The book is
written in a style of sober and stately dignity, with great acuteness
of insight and weightiness of comment; it incorporates part of an
autobiography afterwards published separately, and is rather out of
proportion. His other works are 'The Essay on an Active and Contemplative

<h3><a name="THE_CHARACTER_OF_LORD_FALKLAND" id="THE_CHARACTER_OF_LORD_FALKLAND"></a>THE CHARACTER OF LORD FALKLAND</h3>

<p>If celebrating the memory of eminent and extraordinary persons,
and transmitting their great virtues for the imitation
of posterity, be one of the principal ends and duties of history,
it will not be thought impertinent in this place to remember
a loss which no time will suffer to be forgotten, and no
success or good fortune could repair. In this unhappy battle
was slain the Lord Viscount Falkland; a person of such prodigious
parts of learning and knowledge, of that inimitable sweetness
and delight in conversation, of so flowing and obliging a humanity
and goodness to mankind, and of that primitive simplicity
and integrity of life, that if there were no other brand upon this
odious and accursed civil war than that single loss, it must be
most infamous and execrable to all posterity.</p>

<p>Before this Parliament, his condition of life was so happy
that it was hardly capable of improvement. Before he came to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3739]</span>
twenty years of age he was master of a noble fortune, which
descended to him by the gift of a grandfather without passing
through his father or mother, who were then both alive, and not
well enough contented to find themselves passed by in the
descent. His education for some years had been in Ireland,
where his father was Lord Deputy; so that when he returned
into England to the possession of his fortune, he was unentangled
with any acquaintance or friends, which usually grow up
by the custom of conversation; and therefore was to make a
pure election of his company, which he chose by other rules
than were prescribed to the young nobility of that time. And
it cannot be denied, though he admitted some few to his friendship
for the agreeableness of their natures and their undoubted
affection to him, that his familiarity and friendship, for the
most part, was with men of the most eminent and sublime parts,
and of untouched reputation in the point of integrity; and such
men had a title to his bosom.</p>

<p>He was a great cherisher of wit and fancy and good parts in
any man; and if he found them clouded with poverty or want, a
most liberal and bountiful patron towards them, even above his
fortune; of which, in those administrations, he was such a dispenser
as if he had been trusted with it to such uses; and if
there had been the least of vice in his expense he might have been
thought too prodigal. He was constant and pertinacious in
whatsoever he resolved to do, and not to be wearied by any
pains that were necessary to that end. And therefore having
once resolved not to see London, which he loved above all
places, till he had perfectly learned the Greek tongue, he went
to his own house in the country and pursued it with that indefatigable
industry that it will not be believed in how short a
time he was master of it, and accurately read all the Greek
historians.</p>

<p>In this time, his house being within ten miles of Oxford, he
contracted familiarity and friendship with the most polite and
accurate men of that university; who found such an immenseness
of wit and such a solidity of judgment in him, so infinite a
fancy bound in by a most logical ratiocination, such a vast
knowledge that he was not ignorant in anything, yet such an
excessive humility as if he had known nothing, that they frequently
resorted and dwelt with him, as in a college situated in
a purer air; so that his house was a university bound in a less<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3740]</span>
volume, whither they came not so much for repose as study, and
to examine and refine those grosser propositions which laziness
and consent made current in vulgar conversation....</p>

<p>The great opinion he had of the uprightness and integrity of
those persons who appeared most active, especially of Mr. Hampden,
kept him longer from suspecting any design against the
peace of the kingdom; and though he differed commonly from
them in conclusions, he believed long their purposes were honest.
When he grew better informed what was law, and discerned (in
them) a desire to control that law by a vote of one or both
Houses, no man more opposed those attempts, and gave the
adverse party more trouble by reason and argumentation; insomuch
as he was, by degrees, looked upon as an advocate for the
court, to which he contributed so little that he declined those
addresses and even those invitations which he was obliged
almost by civility to entertain. And he was so jealous of the
least imagination that he should incline to preferment, that he
affected even a morosity to the court and to the courtiers, and
left nothing undone which might prevent and divert the King's
or Queen's favor towards him, but the deserving it. For when
the King sent for him once or twice to speak with him, and to
give him thanks for his excellent comportment in those councils
which his Majesty graciously termed doing him service, his
answers were more negligent and less satisfactory than might
have been expected; as if he cared only that his actions should
be just, not that they should be acceptable, and that his Majesty
should think that they proceeded only from the impulsion of
conscience, without any sympathy in his affections; which from a
stoical and sullen nature might not have been misinterpreted;
yet from a person of so perfect a habit of generous and obsequious
compliance with all good men, might very well have been
interpreted by the King as more than an ordinary averseness to
his service: so that he took more pains and more forced his
nature to actions unagreeable and unpleasant to it, that he might
not be thought to incline to the court, than any man hath done
to procure an office there....</p>

<p>Two reasons prevailed with him to receive the seals, and but
for those he had resolutely avoided them. The first, consideration
that it [his refusal] might bring some blemish upon the King's
affairs, and that men would have believed that he had refused
so great an honor and trust because he must have been with it<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3741]</span>
obliged to do somewhat else not justifiable. And this he made
matter of conscience, since he knew the King made choice of him
before other men especially because he thought him more honest
than other men. The other was, lest he might be thought to
avoid it out of fear to do an ungracious thing to the House of
Commons, who were sorely troubled at the displacing of Harry
Vane, whom they looked upon as removed for having done them
those offices they stood in need of; and the disdain of so popular
an incumbrance wrought upon him next to the other. For
as he had a full appetite of fame by just and generous actions,
so he had an equal contempt of it by any servile expedients;
and he had so much the more consented to and approved the
justice upon Sir Harry Vane in his own private judgment, by
how much he surpassed most men in the religious observation of
a trust, the violation whereof he would not admit of any excuse
for.</p>

<p>For these reasons he submitted to the King's command and
became his secretary, with as humble and devout an acknowledgment
of the greatness of the obligation as could be expressed,
and as true a sense of it in his own heart. Yet two things he
could never bring himself to whilst he continued in that office, that
was to his death; for which he was contented to be reproached,
as for omissions in a most necessary part of his office. The one,
employing of spies, or giving any countenance or entertainment
to them. I do not mean such emissaries as with danger would
venture to view the enemy's camp and bring intelligence of
their number and quartering, or such generals as such an observation
can comprehend; but those who by communication of
guilt or dissimulation of manners wound themselves into such
trusts and secrets as enabled them to make discoveries for the benefit
of the State. The other, the liberty of opening letters upon
a suspicion that they might contain matter of dangerous consequence.
For the first he would say, such instruments must be
void of all ingenuity and common honesty, before they could be
of use; and afterwards they could never be fit to be credited:
and that no single preservation could be worth so general a
wound and corruption of human society as the cherishing such
persons would carry with it. The last, he thought such a violation
of the law of nature that no qualification by office could
justify a single person in the trespass; and though he was convinced
by the necessity and iniquity of the time that those<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3742]</span>
advantages of information were not to be declined and were
necessarily to be practiced, he found means to shift it from himself;
when he confessed he needed excuse and pardon for the
omission: so unwilling he was to resign anything in his nature
to an obligation in his office.</p>

<p>In all other particulars he filled his place plentifully, being
sufficiently versed in languages to understand any that [are] used
in business, and to make himself again understood. To speak
of his integrity, and his high disdain of any bait that might
seem to look towards corruption, <i>in tanto viro, injuria virtutum
fuerit</i> [in the case of so great a man, would be an insult to his
merits]....</p>

<p>He had a courage of the most clear and keen temper, and so
far from fear that he was not without appetite of danger; and
therefore, upon any occasion of action, he always engaged his
person in those troops which he thought by the forwardness of
the commanders to be most like to be farthest engaged; and in
all such encounters he had about him a strange cheerfulness and
companionableness, without at all affecting the execution that
was then principally to be attended, in which he took no
delight, but took pains to prevent it, where it was not by
resistance necessary; insomuch that at Edgehill, when the
enemy was routed, he was like to have incurred great peril by
interposing to save those who had thrown away their arms, and
against whom, it may be, others were more fierce for their having
thrown them away: insomuch as a man might think he
came into the field only out of curiosity to see the face of
danger, and charity to prevent the shedding of blood. Yet in
his natural inclination he acknowledged that he was addicted to
the profession of a soldier; and shortly after he came to his
fortune, and before he came to age, he went into the Low
Countries with a resolution of procuring command, and to give
himself up to it, from which he was converted by the complete
inactivity of that summer: and so he returned into England and
shortly after entered upon that vehement course of study we
mentioned before, till the first alarm from the North; and then
again he made ready for the field, and though he received some
repulse in the command of a troop of horse of which he had a
promise, he went volunteer with the Earl of Essex.</p>

<p>From the entrance into this unnatural war his natural cheerfulness
and vivacity grew clouded, and a kind of sadness and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3743]</span>
dejection of spirit stole upon him which he had never been
used to; yet being one of those who believed that one battle
would end all differences, and that there would be so great a
victory on the one side that the other would be compelled to
submit to any conditions from the victor (which supposition and
conclusion generally sunk into the minds of most men, and prevented
the looking after many advantages which might then
have been laid hold of), he resisted those indispositions, <i>et in
luctu, bellum inter remedia erat</i> [and in his grief, strife was one
of his curatives]. But after the King's return from Brentford,
and the furious resolution of the two Houses not to admit any
treaty for peace, those indispositions which had before touched
him grew into a perfect habit of uncheerfulness; and he who
had been so exactly unreserved and affable to all men that his
face and countenance was always present and vacant to his company,
and held any cloudiness and less pleasantness of the visage
a kind of rudeness or incivility, became, on a sudden, less communicable;
and thence, very sad, pale, and exceedingly affected
with the spleen. In his clothes and habit, which he had
intended before always with more neatness and industry and
expense than is usual in so great a mind, he was now not only
incurious, but too negligent; and in his reception of suitors, and
the necessary or casual addresses to his place, so quick and
sharp and severe that there wanted not some men (who were
strangers to his nature and disposition) who believed him proud
and imperious,&mdash;from which no mortal man was ever more free.</p>

<p>The truth is, that as he was of a most incomparable gentleness,
application, and even a demissness and submission to good
and worthy and entire men, so he was naturally (which could not
but be more evident in his place, which objected him to another
conversation and intermixture than his own election had done)
<i>adversus malos injucundus</i> [toward evil-doers ungracious] and was
so ill a dissembler of his dislike and disinclination to ill men
that it was not possible for such not to discern it. There was
once in the House of Commons such a declared acceptation of
the good service an eminent member had done to them, and as
they said, to the whole kingdom, that it was moved, he being
present, that the Speaker might in the name of the whole House
give him thanks; and then, that every member might as a testimony
of his particular acknowledgment stir or move his hat
towards him; the which (though not ordered) when very many<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3744]</span>
did, the Lord Falkland (who believed the service itself not to be
of that moment, and that an honorable and generous person
could not have stooped to it for any recompense), instead of
moving his hat, stretched both his arms out and clasped his
hands together upon the crown of his hat, and held it close
down to his head; that all men might see how odious that flattery
was to him, and the very approbation of the person, though
at that time most popular.</p>

<p>When there was any overture or hope of peace, he would be
more erect and vigorous, and exceedingly solicitous to press
anything which he thought might promote it; and sitting amongst
his friends, often, after a deep silence and frequent sighs, would
with a shrill and sad accent ingeminate the word <i>Peace, Peace</i>;
and would passionately profess that the very agony of the war
and the view of the calamities and desolation the kingdom
did and must endure, took his sleep from him, and would
shortly break his heart. This made some think or pretend to
think that he was so much enamored on peace, that he would
have been glad the King should have bought it at any price;
which was a most unreasonable calumny. As if a man that
was himself the most punctual and precise in every circumstance
that might reflect upon conscience or honor, could have wished
the King to have committed a trespass against either....</p>

<p>In the morning before the battle, as always upon action, he
was very cheerful, and put himself into the first rank of the
Lord Byron's regiment, who was then advancing upon the
enemy, who had lined the hedges on both sides with musketeers,
from whence he was shot with a musket in the lower part of the
belly, and in the instant falling from his horse, his body was
not found till the next morning; till when, there was some hope
he might have been a prisoner; though his nearest friends, who
knew his temper, received small comfort from that imagination.
Thus fell that incomparable young man, in the four-and-thirtieth
year of his age, having so much dispatched the business of life
that the oldest rarely attain to that immense knowledge, and the
youngest enter not into the world with more innocence: and
whosoever leads such a life needs not care upon how short
warning it be taken from him.</p>

<h2><a name="MARCUS_AH_CLARKE" id="MARCUS_AH_CLARKE"></a>MARCUS A. H. CLARKE</h2>

<h4>(1846-1881)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capa.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">lthough a native of England, Marcus Clarke is always classed
as an Australian novelist. The son of a barrister, he was
born in Kensington April 24th, 1846. In 1864 he went to
seek his fortune in Australia. His taste for adventure soon led him
to "the bush," where he acquired many experiences afterwards used
by him for literary material. Drifting into journalism, he joined the
staff of the Melbourne Argus. After publishing a series of essays
called 'The Peripatetic Philosopher,' he purchased the Australian
Magazine, the name of which he changed to the Colonial Monthly,
and in 1868 published in it his first novel, entitled 'Long Odds.'
Owing to a long illness, this tale of sporting life was completed by
other hands. When he resumed his literary work he contributed to
the Melbourne Punch, and edited the Humbug, a humorous journal.
He dramatized Charles Reade's and Dion Boucicault's novel of 'Foul
Play'; adapted Moliere's 'Bourgeois Gentilhomme'; wrote a drama
entitled 'Plot,' successfully performed at the Princess Theatre in
1873; and another play called 'A Daughter of Eve.' He was connected
with the Melbourne press until his death, August 2d, 1881.</p>

<p>Clarke's literary fame rests upon the novel 'His Natural Life,'
a strong story, describing the life of an innocent man under a life
sentence for felony. The story is repulsive, but gives a faithful
picture of the penal conditions of the time, and is built upon official
records. It appeared in the Australian Magazine, and before it was
issued in book form, Clarke, with the assistance of Sir Charles Gavin
Duffy, revised it almost beyond recognition. It was republished in
London in 1875 and in New York in 1878. He was also the author
of 'Old Tales of a New Country'; 'Holiday Peak,' another collection
of short stories; 'Four Stories High'; and an unfinished novel
called 'Felix and Felicitas.'</p>

<p>Clarke was a devoted student of Balzac and Poe, and some of his
sketches of rough life in Australia have been compared to Bret
Harte's pictures of primitive California days. His power in depicting
landscape is shown by this glimpse of a midnight ride in the bush,
taken from 'Holiday Peak':&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is an indescribable ghastliness about the mountain bush at midnight,
which has affected most imaginative people. The grotesque and distorted
trees, huddled here and there together in the gloom like whispering<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3746]</span>
conspirators; the little open flats encircled by bowlders, which seem the forgotten
altars of some unholy worship; the white, bare, and ghostly gum-trees,
gleaming momentarily amid the deeper shades of the forest; the lonely pools
begirt with shivering reeds and haunted by the melancholy bittern only; the
rifted and draggled creek-bed, which seems violently gouged out of the lacerated
earth by some savage convulsion of nature; the silent and solitary places
where a few blasted trees crouch together like withered witches, who, brooding
on some deed of blood, have suddenly been stricken horror-stiff. Riding
through this nightmare landscape, a whirr of wings and a harsh cry disturb
you from time to time, hideous and mocking laughter peals above and about
you, and huge gray ghosts with little red eyes hop away in gigantic but
noiseless bounds. You shake your bridle, the mare lengthens her stride, the
tree-trunks run into one another, the leaves make overhead a continuous curtain,
the earth reels out beneath you like a strip of gray cloth spun by a
furiously flying loom, the air strikes your face sharply, the bush&mdash;always gray
and colorless&mdash;parts before you and closes behind you like a fog. You lose
yourself in this prevailing indecision of sound and color. You become drunk
with the wine of the night, and losing your individuality, sweep onward, a
flying phantom in a land of shadows."</p>

<h3><a name="HOW_A_PENAL_SYSTEM_CAN_WORK" id="HOW_A_PENAL_SYSTEM_CAN_WORK"></a>HOW A PENAL SYSTEM CAN WORK</h3>

<h4>From 'His Natural Life'</h4>

<p>The next two days were devoted to sight-seeing. Sylvia Frere
was taken through the hospital and the workshops, shown
the semaphores, and shut up by Maurice in a "dark cell."
Her husband and Burgess seemed to treat the prison like a tame
animal, whom they could handle at their leisure, and whose
natural ferocity was kept in check by their superior intelligence.
This bringing of a young and pretty woman into immediate
contact with bolts and bars had about it an incongruity which
pleased them. Maurice Frere penetrated everywhere, questioned
the prisoners, jested with the jailers; even, in the munificence of
his heart, bestowed tobacco on the sick.</p>

<p>With such graceful rattlings of dry bones, they got by-and-by
to Point Puer, where a luncheon had been provided.</p>

<p>An unlucky accident had occurred at Point Puer that morning,
however; and the place was in a suppressed ferment. A
refractory little thief named Peter Brown, aged twelve years,
had jumped off the high rock and drowned himself in full view
of the constables. These "jumpings-off" had become rather
frequent lately, and Burgess was enraged at one happening on<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3747]</span>
this particular day. If he could by any possibility have brought
the corpse of poor little Peter Brown to life again, he would
have soundly whipped it for its impertinence.</p>

<p>"It is most unfortunate," he said to Frere, as they stood in
the cell where the little body was laid, "that it should have
happened to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh," says Frere, frowning down upon the young face that
seemed to smile up at him, "it can't be helped. I know those
young devils. They'd do it out of spite. What sort of a character
had he?"</p>

<p>"Very bad. Johnson, the book."</p>

<p>Johnson bringing it, the two saw Peter Brown's iniquities set
down in the neatest of running-hand, and the record of his
punishments ornamented in quite an artistic way with flourishes
of red ink.</p>

<p>"20th November, disorderly conduct, 12 lashes. 24th November,
insolence to hospital attendant, diet reduced. 4th December,
stealing cap from another prisoner, 12 lashes. 15th December,
absenting himself at roll-call, two days' cells. 23d December,
insolence and insubordination, two days' cells. 8th January,
insolence and insubordination, 12 lashes. 20th January, insolence
and insubordination, 12 lashes. 22d February, insolence and
insubordination, 12 lashes and one week's solitary. 6th March,
insolence and insubordination, 20 lashes."</p>

<p>"That was the last?" asked Frere.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," says Johnson.</p>

<p>"And then he&mdash;hum&mdash;did it?"</p>

<p>"Just so, sir. That was the way of it."</p>

<p>Just so! The magnificent system starved and tortured a child
of twelve until he killed himself. That was the way of it....</p>

<p>After the farce had been played again, and the children had
stood up and sat down, and sung a hymn, and told how many
twice five were, and repeated their belief in "One God the
Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and earth," the party reviewed
the workshops, and saw the church, and went everywhere
but into the room where the body of Peter Brown, aged twelve,
lay starkly on its wooden bench, staring at the jail roof which
was between it and heaven.</p>

<p>Just outside this room Sylvia met with a little adventure.
Meekin had stopped behind, and Burgess being suddenly summoned
for some official duty, Frere had gone with him, leaving<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3748]</span>
his wife to rest on a bench that, placed at the summit of the
cliff, overlooked the sea. While resting thus she became aware
of another presence, and turning her head, beheld a small boy
with his cap in one hand and a hammer in the other. The
appearance of the little creature, clad in a uniform of gray cloth
that was too large for him, and holding in his withered little
hand a hammer that was too heavy for him, had something
pathetic about it.</p>

<p>"What is it, you mite?" asked Sylvia.</p>

<p>"We thought you might have seen him, mum," said the little
figure, opening its blue eyes with wonder at the kindness of the
tone.</p>

<p>"Him? Whom?"</p>

<p>"Cranky Brown, mum," returned the child; "him as did it
this morning. Me and Billy knowed him, mum; he was a mate
of ours, and we wanted to know if he looked happy."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, child?" said she, with a strange terror
at her heart; and then, filled with pity at the aspect of the little
being, she drew him to her, with sudden womanly instinct, and
kissed him.</p>

<p>He looked up at her with joyful surprise. "Oh!" he said.</p>

<p>Sylvia kissed him again.</p>

<p>"Does nobody ever kiss you, poor little man?" said she.</p>

<p>"Mother used to," was the reply; "but she's at home. Oh,
mem," with a sudden crimsoning of the little face, "may I fetch
Billy?"</p>

<p>And taking courage from the bright young face, he gravely
marched to an angle of the rock, and brought out another little
creature, with another gray uniform, and another hammer.</p>

<p>"This is Billy, mum," he said. "Billy never had no mother.
Kiss Billy."</p>

<p>The young wife felt the tears rush to her eyes.</p>

<p>"You two poor babies!" she cried. And then, forgetting that
she was a lady, dressed in silk and lace, she fell on her knees
in the dust, and folding the friendless pair in her arms, wept
over them.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Sylvia?" said Frere, when he came up.
"You've been crying."</p>

<p>"Nothing, Maurice; at least, I will tell you by-and-by."</p>

<p>When they were alone that evening she told him of the two
little boys, and he laughed.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3749]</span></p>

<p>"Artful little humbugs," he said, and supported his argument
by so many illustrations of the precocious wickedness of juvenile
felons that his wife was half convinced against her will.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when Sylvia went away, Tommy and Billy put
into execution a plan which they had carried in their poor little
heads for some weeks.</p>

<p>"I can do it now," said Tommy. "I feel strong."</p>

<p>"Will it hurt much, Tommy?" said Billy, who was not so
courageous.</p>

<p>"Not so much as a whipping."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid! Oh, Tom, it's so deep! Don't leave me, Tom!"</p>

<p>The bigger boy took his little handkerchief from his neck,
and with it bound his own left hand to his companion's right.</p>

<p>"Now I <i>can't</i> leave you."</p>

<p>"What was it the lady that kissed us said, Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Lord, have pity of them two fatherless children!" repeated
Tommy.</p>

<p>"Let's say it, Tom."</p>

<p>And so the two babies knelt on the brink of the cliff, and
raising the bound hands together, looked up at the sky, and
ungrammatically said, "Lord, have pity on we two fatherless
children." And then they kissed each other, and "did it."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_VALLEY_OF_THE_SHADOW_OF_DEATH" id="THE_VALLEY_OF_THE_SHADOW_OF_DEATH"></a>THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH</h3>

<h4>From 'His Natural Life'</h4>

<p>It was not until they had scrambled up the beach to safety that
the absconders became fully aware of the loss of another of
their companions. As they stood on the break of the beach,
wringing the water from their clothes, Gabbett's small eye,
counting their number, missed the stroke oar.</p>

<p>"Where's Cox?"</p>

<p>"The fool fell overboard," said Jemmy Vetch, shortly. "He
never had as much sense in that skull of his as would keep it
sound on his shoulders."</p>

<p>Gabbett scowled. "That's three of us gone," he said, in the
tones of a man suffering some personal injury.</p>

<p>They summed up their means of defense against attack.
Sanders and Greenhill had knives. Gabbett still retained the axe
in his belt. Vetch had dropped his musket at the Neck; and
Bodenham and Cornelius were unarmed.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3750]</span></p>

<p>"Let's have a look at the tucker," said Vetch.</p>

<p>There was but one bag of provisions. It contained a piece of
salt pork, two loaves, and some uncooked potatoes. Signal Hill
station was not rich in edibles.</p>

<p>"That ain't much," said the Crow, with rueful face. "Is it,
Gabbett?"</p>

<p>"It must do, anyway," returned the giant, carelessly.</p>

<p>The inspection over, the six proceeded up the shore, and
encamped under the lee of a rock. Bodenham was for lighting
a fire; but Vetch, who by tacit consent had been chosen leader
of the expedition, forbade it, saying that the light might betray
them. "They'll think we're drowned, and won't pursue us," he
said. So all that night the miserable wretches crouched fireless
together.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Morning breaks clear and bright, and&mdash;free for the first time
in ten years&mdash;they comprehend that their terrible journey has
begun. "Where are we to go? How are we to live?" asks
Bodenham, scanning the barren bush that stretches to the barren
sea. "Gabbett, you've been out before&mdash;how's it done?"</p>

<p>"We'll make the shepherds' huts, and live on their tucker till
we get a change o'clothes," said Gabbett, evading the main question.
"We can follow the coast-line."</p>

<p>"Steady, lads," said prudent Vetch; "we must sneak round
yon sandhills, and so creep into the scrub. If they've a good
glass at the Neck, they can see us."</p>

<p>"It does seem close," said Bodenham, "I could pitch a stone
on to the guard-house. Good-by, you bloody spot!" he adds,
with sudden rage, shaking his fist vindictively at the penitentiary,
"I don't want to see you no more till the Day o' Judgment."</p>

<p>Vetch divides the provisions, and they travel all that day
until dark night. The scrub is prickly and dense. Their clothes
are torn, their hands and feet bleeding. Already they feel
out-wearied. No one pursuing, they light a fire, and sleep. The
second day they come to a sandy spit that runs out into the sea,
and find that they have got too far to the eastward, and must
follow the shore-line to East Bay Neck. Back through the scrub
they drag their heavy feet. That night they eat the last crumb
of the loaf. The third day at high noon, after some toilsome
walking, they reach a big hill, now called Collins's Mount, and
see the upper link of the ear-ring, the isthmus of East Bay<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3751]</span>
Neck, at their feet. A few rocks are on their right hand,
and blue in the lovely distance lies hated Maria Island. "We
must keep well to the eastward," said Greenhill, "or we shall
fall in with the settlers and get taken." So, passing the isthmus,
they strike into the bush along the shore, and tightening
their belts over their gnawing bellies, camp under some low-lying
hills.</p>

<p>The fourth day is notable for the indisposition of Bodenham,
who is a bad walker, and falling behind, delays the party by frequent
cooeys. Gabbett threatens him with a worse fate than
sore feet if he lingers. Luckily, that evening Greenhill espies a
hut; but not trusting to the friendship of the occupant, they wait
until he quits it in the morning, and then send Vetch to forage.
Vetch, secretly congratulating himself on having by his counsel
prevented violence, returns bending under half a bag of flour.
"You'd better carry the flour," said he to Gabbett, "and give
me the axe." Gabbett eyes him for a while, as if struck by his
puny form, but finally gives the axe to his mate Sanders. That
day they creep along cautiously between the sea and the hills,
camping at a creek. Vetch, after much search, finds a handful
of berries, and adds them to the main stock. Half of this handful
is eaten at once, the other half reserved for "to-morrow."
The next day they come to an arm of the sea, and as they
struggle northward Maria Island disappears, and with it all
danger from telescopes. That evening they reach the camping-ground
by twos and threes; and each wonders&mdash;between the
paroxysms of hunger&mdash;if his face is as haggard and his eyes as
blood-shot as those of his neighbor.</p>

<p>On the seventh day Bodenham says his feet are so bad he
can't walk, and Greenhill, with a greedy look at the berries, bids
him stay behind. Being in a very weak condition, he takes his
companion at his word, and drops off about noon the next day.
Gabbett, discovering this defection, however, goes back, and in
an hour or so appears, driving the wretched creature before him
with blows, as a sheep is driven to the shambles. Greenhill
remonstrates at another mouth being thus forced upon the party,
but the giant silences him with a hideous glance. Jemmy Vetch
remembers that Greenhill accompanied Gabbett once before, and
feels uncomfortable. He gives hint of his suspicions to Sanders,
but Sanders only laughs. It is horribly evident that there is an
understanding among the three.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3752]</span></p>

<p>The ninth sun of their freedom, rising upon sandy and barren
hillocks, bristling thick with cruel scrub, sees the six famine-stricken
wretches cursing their God, and yet afraid to die. All
round is the fruitless, shadeless, shelterless bush. Above, the
pitiless heaven. In the distance the remorseless sea. Something
terrible must happen. That gray wilderness, arched by gray
heaven stooping to gray sea, is a fitting keeper of hideous
secrets. Vetch suggests that Oyster Bay cannot be far to the
eastward,&mdash;the line of ocean is deceitfully close,&mdash;and though
such a proceeding will take them out of their course, they
resolve to make for it. After hobbling five miles they seem no
nearer than before, and nigh dead with fatigue and starvation,
sink despairingly upon the ground. Vetch thinks Gabbett's eyes
have a wolfish glare in them, and instinctively draws off from
him. Said Greenhill, in the course of a dismal conversation, "I
am so weak that I could eat a piece of a man."</p>

<p>On the tenth day Bodenham refuses to stir, and the others,
being scarcely able to drag along their limbs, sit on the ground
about him. Greenhill, eyeing the prostrate man, said slowly, "I
have seen the same done before, boys, and it tasted like pork."</p>

<p>Vetch, hearing his savage comrade give utterance to a
thought all had secretly cherished, speaks out, crying, "It would
be murder to do it; and then perhaps we couldn't eat it."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Gabbett, with a grin, "I'll warrant you that; but
you must all have a hand in it."</p>

<p>Gabbett, Sanders, and Greenhill then go aside, and presently
Sanders, coming to the Crow, said, "He consented to act as
flogger. He deserves it."</p>

<p>"So did Gabbett, for that matter," shudders Vetch.</p>

<p>"Ay, but Bodenham's feet are sore," said Sanders, "and 'tis
a pity to leave him."</p>

<p>Having no fire, they made a little break-wind; and Vetch,
half dozing behind this, at about three in the morning hears
some one cry out "Christ!" and awakes, sweating ice.</p>

<p>No one but Gabbett and Greenhill would eat that night.
That savage pair, however, make a fire, fling ghastly fragments
on the embers, and eat the broil before it is right warm. In
the morning the frightful carcass is divided.</p>

<p>That day's march takes place in silence, and at the mid-day
halt Cornelius volunteers to carry the billy, affecting great
restoration from the food. Vetch gives it him, and in half an<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3753]</span>
hour afterward Cornelius is missing. Gabbett and Greenhill
pursue him in vain, and return with curses. "He'll die like a
dog," said Greenhill, "alone in the bush." Jemmy Vetch, with
his intellect acute as ever, thinks that Cornelius prefers such a
death to the one in store for him, but says nothing.</p>

<p>The twelfth morning dawns wet and misty, but Vetch, seeing
the provision running short, strives to be cheerful, telling stories
of men who have escaped greater peril. Vetch feels with dismay
that he is the weakest of the party, but has some sort of
ludicro-horrible consolation in remembering that he is also the
leanest. They come to a creek that afternoon, and look until
nightfall in vain for a crossing-place. The next day Gabbett and
Vetch swim across, and Vetch directs Gabbett to cut a long sapling,
which being stretched across the water, is seized by Greenhill
and the Moocher, who are dragged over.</p>

<p>"What would you do without me?" said the Crow, with a
ghastly grin.</p>

<p>They cannot kindle a fire, for Greenhill, who carries the tinder,
has allowed it to get wet. The giant swings his axe in
savage anger at enforced cold, and Vetch takes an opportunity
to remark privately to him what a <i>big</i> man Greenhill is.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth day they can scarcely crawl, and their
limbs pain them. Greenhill, who is the weakest, sees Gabbett
and the Moocher go aside to consult, and crawling to the Crow,
whimpers, "For God's sake, Jemmy, don't let 'em murder me!"</p>

<p>"I can't help you," says Vetch, looking about in terror.
"Think of poor Tom Bodenham."</p>

<p>"But he was no murderer. If they kill me, I shall go to hell
with Tom's blood on my soul."</p>

<p>He writhes on the ground in sickening terror, and Gabbett,
arriving, bids Vetch bring wood for the fire. Vetch going, sees
Greenhill clinging to wolfish Gabbett's knees, and Sanders calls
after him, "You will hear it presently, Jem."</p>

<p>The nervous Crow puts his hands to his ears, but is conscious,
nevertheless, of a dull crash and a groan. When he comes
back, Gabbett is putting on the dead man's shoes, which are
better than his own.</p>

<p>"We'll stop here a day or so and rest," said he, "now we've
got provisions."</p>

<p>Two more days pass, and the three, eying each other suspiciously,
resume their march. The third day&mdash;the sixteenth of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3754]</span>
their awful journey&mdash;such portions of the carcass as they have
with them prove unfit to eat. They look into each other's famine-sharpened
faces, and wonder "Who next?"</p>

<p>"We must all die together," said Sanders, quickly, "before
anything else must happen."</p>

<p>Vetch marks the terror concealed in the words, and when the
dreaded giant is out of ear-shot, says, "For God's sake, let's go
on alone, Alick. You see what sort of a cove that Gabbett is,&mdash;he'd
kill his father before he'd fast one day."</p>

<p>They made for the bush, but the giant turned and strode
toward them. Vetch skipped nimbly on one side, but Gabbett
struck the Moocher on the forehead with the axe. "Help! Jem,
help!" cried the victim, cut but not fatally, and in the strength
of his desperation tore the axe from the monster who bore it,
and flung it to Vetch. "Keep it. Jemmy," he cried; "let's have
no more murder done!"</p>

<p>They fare again through the horrible bush until nightfall,
when Vetch, in a strange voice, called the giant to him.</p>

<p>"He must die."</p>

<p>"Either you or he," laughs Gabbett.  "Give me the axe."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the Crow, his thin malignant face distorted
by a horrible resolution. "I'll keep the axe. Stand back! You
shall hold him, and I'll do the job."</p>

<p>Sanders, seeing them approach, knew his end had come, and
submitted, crying, "Give me half an hour to pray for myself."
They consent, and the bewildered wretch knelt down and
folded his hands like a child. His big stupid face worked with
emotion. His great cracked lips moved in desperate agony.
He wagged his head from side to side, in pitiful confusion of
his brutalized senses. "I can't think o' the words, Jem!"</p>

<p>"Pah," snarled the cripple, swinging the axe, "we can't
starve here all night."</p>

<p>Four days had passed, and the two survivors of this awful
journey sat watching each other. The gaunt giant, his eyes
gleaming with hate and hunger, sat sentinel over the dwarf.
The dwarf, chuckling at his superior sagacity, clutched the fatal
axe. For two days they had not spoken to each other. For two
days each had promised himself that on the next his companion
must <i>sleep</i>&mdash;and die. Vetch comprehended the devilish scheme
of the monster who had entrapped five of his fellow-beings to
aid him by their deaths to his own safety, and held aloof.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3755]</span>
Gabbett watched to snatch the weapon from his companion, and
make the odds even for once and forever. In the daytime they
traveled on, seeking each a pretext to creep behind the other.
In the night-time when they feigned slumber, each stealthily
raising a head caught the wakeful glance of his companion.
Vetch felt his strength deserting him, and his brain overpowered
by fatigue. Surely the giant, muttering, gesticulating, and
slavering at the mouth, was on the road to madness. Would the
monster find opportunity to rush at him, and braving the
blood-stained axe, kill him by main force? or would he sleep, and be
himself a victim? Unhappy Vetch! It is the terrible privilege
of insanity to be sleepless.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, Vetch, creeping behind a tree, takes off his
belt, and makes a noose. He will hang himself. He gets one
end of the belt over a bough, and then his cowardice bids him
pause. Gabbett approaches; he tries to evade him, and steal
away into the bush. In vain. The insatiable giant, ravenous
with famine and sustained by madness, is not to be shaken off.
Vetch tries to run, but his legs bend under him. The axe that
has tried to drink so much blood feels heavy as lead. He will
fling it away. No&mdash;he dares not. Night falls again. He must
rest, or go mad. His limbs are powerless. His eyelids are
glued together. He sleeps as he stands. This horrible thing
must be a dream. He is at Port Arthur, or will wake on his
pallet in the penny lodging-house he slept at when a boy. Is
that the deputy come to wake him to the torment of living? It
is not time&mdash;surely not time yet. He sleeps&mdash;and the giant,
grinning with ferocious joy, approaches on clumsy tiptoe and
seizes the coveted axe.</p>

<p>On the northeast coast of Van Diemen's Land is a place
called St. Helen's Point, and a certain skipper, being in want of
fresh water, landing there with a boat's crew, found on the
banks of the creek a gaunt and blood-stained man, clad in
tattered yellow, who carried on his back an axe and a bundle.
When the sailors came within sight of him he made signs to
them to approach, and opening his bundle with much ceremony,
offered them some of its contents. Filled with horror at what
the maniac displayed, they seized and bound him. At Hobart
Town he was recognized as the only survivor of the nine
desperadoes who had escaped from Colonel Arthur's "natural
penitentiary."</p>

<h2><a name="MATTHIAS_CLAUDIUS" id="MATTHIAS_CLAUDIUS"></a>MATTHIAS CLAUDIUS</h2>

<h4>(1740-1815)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capm.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="M" title="M" />
</div><p class="dropcap">atthias Claudius, best known as "the Wandsbecker Bote"
(the Messenger from Wandsbeck), was born at Reinfeld in
Holstein, August 15th, 1740. He was of excellent stock,
coming from a long line of clergymen. It was said that scarcely
another family in Schleswig-Holstein had given to the church so
many sons.</p>

<p>There is but little to record of the quiet boyhood passed in the
picturesque stillness of the North German village. At the outset the
education of Claudius was conducted by his
father, the village pastor. From beginning
to end his life was simple, moderate, and
well ordered. After finishing his school
days at Ploen, he entered the University
of Jena (1759), with the intention of studying
theology, in order to follow the traditions
of the family and enter the ministry.
This idea he was soon obliged to relinquish
on account of a pulmonary weakness, and
he turned instead to the study of jurisprudence.
His strongest attraction was
towards literature. He became a member
of the literary guild in Jena; and later,
when he had attained fame as the "Wandsbecker
Bote," he was intimately associated with Voss, F.L. Stolberg,
Herder, and others of the G&ouml;ttingen fraternity. His first
verses, published in Jena in 1763, under the title "T&auml;ndeleien und
Erz&auml;hlungen' (Trifles and Tales), gave no indication of his talents,
and were no more than the usual student efforts of unconscious
imitation; they have absolutely no poetic value, and are interesting
only as they indicate a stage of development. In editing his works
in later years, Claudius preserved of this early poetry only one song,
'An eine Quelle' (To a Spring).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">
<img src="images/claudius.jpg" width="168" height="211" alt="Matthias Claudius" title="Matthias Claudius" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Matthias Claudius</span></span>
</div>

<p>After leaving the university in 1764, he took a position as private
secretary to Count Holstein in Copenhagen; and here, under
the powerful influence of Klopstock, whose friendship was at this
time the most potent element of his life, and in the brilliant circle
which that poet had drawn around him, Claudius entered fully into<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3757]</span>
the life of sentiment and ideas which conduced so largely to his
intellectual development. Some years later, after a fallow period
spent in the quiet of his father's house at Reinfeld, he settled at
Wandsbeck, near Altona (1771), where in connection with Bode he
published the Wandsbecker Bote, the popular weekly periodical so
indissolubly associated with his name. His contributions under the
name of "Asmus" found everywhere the warmest acceptance. In
1775, through Herder's recommendation, Claudius was appointed
Chief Land Commissioner at Darmstadt; but circumstances rendering
the position uncongenial, he returned to his beloved Wandsbeck,
where he supported his family by his pen until 1788, when Crown
Prince Frederick of Denmark appointed him revisor of the Holstein
Bank at Altona. He died in Hamburg, January 1st, 1815, in the
house of his son-in-law, the bookseller Perthes.</p>

<p>A collection of his works, with the title 'Asmus omnia sua secum
portans, oder S&auml;mmtliche Werke des Wandsbecker Boten' (The Collected
Works of the Wandsbeck Messenger), appeared at Hamburg,
1775-1812. These collected works comprise songs, romances, fables,
poems, letters, etc., originally published in various places. The
translation of Saint Martin and F&eacute;nelon marked the pietistic spirit of
his later years, and is in strong contrast to the exuberance which
produced the 'Rheinweinlied' (Rhine Wine Song) and 'Urian's Reise
um die Welt' (Urian's Journey around the World).</p>

<p>Claudius as a poet won the hearts of his countrymen. His verses
express his idyllic love of nature and his sympathy with rustic life.
The poet and the man are one. His pure and simple style appealed
to the popular taste, and some of his lyrics have become genuine
folk-songs.</p>

<h3><a name="SPECULATIONS_ON_NEW_YEARS_DAY" id="SPECULATIONS_ON_NEW_YEARS_DAY"></a>SPECULATIONS ON NEW YEAR'S DAY</h3>

<h4>From the Wandsbecker Bote</h4>

<p>A happy new year! A happy new year to my dear country,
the land of old integrity and truth! A happy new year to
friends and enemies, Christians and Turks, Hottentots and
Cannibals! To all on whom God permits his sun to rise and his
rain to fall! Also to the poor negro slaves who have to work
all day in the hot sun.  It's wholly a glorious day, the New
Year's Day! At other times I can bear that a man should be a
little bit patriotic, and not make court to other nations. True,
one must not speak evil of any nation. The wiser part are
everywhere silent; and who would revile a whole nation for the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3758]</span>
sake of the loud ones? As I said, I can bear at other times
that a man should be a little patriotic: but on New Year's Day
my patriotism is dead as a mouse, and it seems to me on that
day as if we were all brothers, and had one Father who is in
heaven; as if all the goods of the world were water which God
has created for all men, as I once heard it said.</p>

<p>And so I am accustomed, every New Year's morning, to sit
down on a stone by the wayside, to scratch with my staff in the
sand before me, and to think of this and of that. Not of my
readers. I hold them in all honor: but on New Year's morning,
on the stone by the wayside, I think not of them; but I sit
there and think that during the past year I saw the sun rise so
often, and the moon,&mdash;that I saw so many rainbows and flowers,
and breathed the air so often, and drank from the brook,&mdash;and
then I do not like to look up, and I take with both hands my
cap from my head and look into that.</p>

<p>Then I think also of my acquaintances who have died during
the year; and how they can talk now with Socrates and Numa,
and other men of whom I have heard so much good, and with
John Huss. And then it seems as if graves opened round me,
and shadows with bald crowns and long gray beards came out of
them and shook the dust out of their beards. That must be the
work of the "Everlasting Huntsman," who has his doings about
the twelfth. The old pious long-beards would fain sleep. But a
glad new year to your memory and to the ashes in your graves!</p>

<h2><a name="HENRY_CLAY" id="HENRY_CLAY"></a>HENRY CLAY</h2>

<h4>(1777-1852)</h4>

<h4>BY JOHN R. PROCTER</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/caph.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="H" title="H" />
</div><p class="dropcap">enry Clay must not be judged as an orator by his reported
speeches, which are but skeletons of the masterly originals,
but by the lasting effect of these speeches on those who
heard them, and by his ability as an originator of important measures
and his success in carrying these measures to a conclusion by
convincing and powerful oratory. Judged by his achievements and
by his wide-spread influence, he must take rank as a statesman and
orator of pre-eminent ability. The son of a poor Baptist clergyman,
with but scant advantages for acquiring an education; leaving home
at an early age and going among strangers to a community where
family ties and social connections were a controlling element;&mdash;this
poor boy, with no family influence, assumed at once, by sheer force
of character and ability, a leadership which he held undisputed until
his death. And years after he had passed away, it was the "followers
of Henry Clay" who kept Kentucky from joining the States
of the South in their unsuccessful efforts to withdraw from the
Union.</p>

<p>Of his oratory Robert C. Winthrop wrote after a lapse of years:
"I can only bear witness to an impressiveness of speech never
exceeded, if ever equaled, within an experience of half a century,
during which I have listened to many of the greatest orators on both
sides of the Atlantic." As a parliamentary leader, Rhodes calls him
the greatest in our history. "His leadership," says Mr. Schurz,
"was not of that mean order which merely contrives to organize a
personal following; it was the leadership of a statesman zealously
striving to promote great public interests."</p>

<p>As a presiding officer he was the most commanding Speaker the
National House of Representatives has ever had. Winthrop, who
served long with him in Congress, said of him:&mdash;"No abler or more
commanding presiding officer ever sat in the Speaker's chair on
either side of the Atlantic. Prompt, dignified, resolute, fearless, he
had a combination of intellectual and physical qualities which made
him a natural ruler over men." He was six times elected Speaker,
sometimes almost by acclamation; and during the many years
which he presided over the House not one of his decisions was ever
reversed.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3762]</span></p>
<p>As a Secretary of State, during his term of four years the treaties
with foreign countries negotiated by him exceeded in numbers
all that had been negotiated by other secretaries, during the previous
thirty-five years of our constitutional history. As a diplomat, he
showed himself at Ghent more than a match for the trained diplomatists
of the old world.</p>

<p>And with all these he was&mdash;at his ideal country home, Ashland,
surrounded by wooded lawns and fertile acres of beautiful blue-grass
land&mdash;a most successful farmer and breeder of thoroughbred stock,
from the Scotch collie to the thoroughbred race-horse. I have been
told by one who knew him as a farmer that no one could guess
nearer to the weight of a Shorthorn bullock than he. He was as
much at home with horses and horsemen as with senators and
diplomats. I have known many men who were friends and followers
of Mr. Clay, and from the love and veneration these men had for his
memory, I can well understand why the historian Rhodes says,
"No man has been loved as the people of the United States loved
Henry Clay."</p>

<p>Clay seemed to have had honors and leadership thrust upon him.
Arriving in Kentucky in 1797, he at once advocated the gradual
emancipation of slaves, regardless of the strong prejudices to the
contrary of the rich slaveholding community in which he had cast
his lot; yet, unsolicited on his part, this community elected him to
the State Legislature by a large majority in 1803, and before three
years of service he was chosen by his fellow members to fill a
vacancy in the United States Senate. And until his death in 1852,
his constituents in Kentucky vied with each other in their desires
to keep him as their representative in either the national Senate or
House of Representatives. He entered the latter in 1811, and was
selected as Speaker of that body almost by acclamation on the first
day of his taking his seat. After a long life spent in his country's
service he was elected <i>unanimously</i> to the Senate in 1848, despite
party strife and the fact that the two parties were almost evenly
divided in Kentucky.</p>

<p>No attempt can here be made to even recapitulate the events of
importance connected with his long public services. I will call attention
only to some of the most important measures which he carried
by his magnificent leadership.</p>

</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">War of 1812</span></h4>

<p>Clay assumed the leadership of those who urged resistance to the
unjust and overbearing encroachments of Great Britain, and he more
than any one else was instrumental in overcoming opposition and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3763]</span>forcing a declaration of war. This war&mdash;a second war for independence,
which changed this country from a disjointed confederacy
liable to fall asunder, to a compact, powerful, and self-respecting
Union&mdash;will ever be regarded as one of the crowning glories of his
long and brilliant career. He proved more than a match in debate
for Randolph, Quincy, and other able advocates for peace. When
asked what we were to gain by war, he answered, "What are we not
to lose by peace? Commerce, character,&mdash;a nation's best treasure,
honor!"</p>

<p>In answer to the arguments that certificates of protection authorized
by Congress were fraudulently used, his magnificent answer,
"The colors that float from the mast-head should be the credentials
of our seamen," electrified the patriots of the country. There is
but a meagre report of this great speech, but the effect produced was
overwhelming and bore down all opposition. It is said that men of
both parties, forgetting all antipathies under the spell of his eloquence,
wept together. Mr. Clay's first speech on entering Congress
was in favor of the encouragement of domestic manufactures, mainly
as a defensive measure in anticipation of a war with Great Britain;
arguing that whatever doubts might be entertained as to the general
policy of encouraging domestic manufactures by import duties, none
could exist regarding the propriety of adopting measures for producing
such articles as are requisite in times of war. If his measure for
the increase of the standing army had been adopted in time, the
humiliating reverses on land during the early part of the war would
have been averted. He carried through a bill for the increase of the
navy, and the brilliant naval victories of the war of 1812 followed.
In the debate on the bill to provide for a standing army, it was
argued that twenty-five thousand could not be had in the United
States. Clay aroused the people of Kentucky to such enthusiasm that
fifteen thousand men volunteered in that State alone, and members of
Congress shouldered their muskets and joined the ranks.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Treaty of Ghent</span></h4>

<p>Henry Clay's faith in the destiny of his country, and his heroic
determination that a continuation of the war was preferable to the
terms proposed, prevented humiliating concessions. The American
Commissioners were Henry Clay, John Quincy Adams, Albert Gallatin,
James A. Bayard, and Jonathan Russell, and the British Commissioners
Lord Gambier, Henry Goulbourn, and William Adams.
The news received by Clay on his arrival in Europe was not calculated
to inspire him with hope. From Mr. Bayard he received a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3764]</span>
letter (dated April 20th, 1814) with news of the triumph of the allies
over Napoleon, and stating:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is reason to think that it has materially changed the views of the
British Ministry.... The great augmentation of their disposable force
presents an additional temptation to prosecute the war."</p>

<p>By the same mail Mr. Gallatin writes from London (April 22d,
1814):&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are sufficiently aware of the total change in our affairs produced by
the late revolution, and by the restoration of universal peace in the European
world, from which we are alone excluded. A well-organized and large army
is at once liberated from any European employment, and ready, together with
a superabundant naval force, to act independently against us. How ill prepared
we are to meet it in a proper manner, no one knows better than yourself;
but above all, our own divisions and the hostile attitude of the Eastern
States give room to apprehend that a continuation of the war might prove
vitally fatal to the United States."</p>

<p>Mr. Russell writes from Stockholm (July 2d, 1814):&mdash;</p>

<p>"My distress at the delay which our joint errand has encountered has
almost been intolerable, and the kind of comfort I have received from Mr.
Adams has afforded very little relief. His apprehensions are rather of a
gloomy cast with regard to the result of our labors."</p>

<p>Mr. Crawford, our Minister to France, who with Clay favored a
vigorous prosecution of the war, writes to him (July 4th, 1814):&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am thoroughly convinced that the United States can never be called
upon to treat under circumstances less auspicious than those which exist at
the present moment, unless our internal bickerings shall continue to weaken
the effects of the government."</p>

<p>With discouraging news from home, the seat of government taken,
and the Capitol burned, the Eastern States opposing the war and
threatening to withdraw from the Union, and his fellow commissioners
in the despondent mood evidenced by the above-quoted letters,&mdash;it
is amazing that Clay, whom some historians have called a
compromiser by nature, opposed any and all concessions and wished
that the war should go on.</p>

<p>By the third article of the treaty of 1783 it was agreed that citizens
of the United States should not fish in the waters or cure fish
on the land of any of the maritime provinces north of the United
States after they were settled, without a previous agreement with the
inhabitants or possessors of the ground.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3765]</span></p>
<p>By the eighth article of the same treaty, it was agreed that the
navigation of the Mississippi River should <i>ever</i> remain free and open
to the subjects of Great Britain and the United States. It was
then supposed that the British Canadian possessions included the
head-waters of this river. By the Jay treaty of 1794 this was confirmed,
and "that all ports and places on its eastern side, to whichsoever
of the parties belonging, might be freely resorted to and used
by both parties." At this time Spain possessed the sovereignty of
the west side of the river, and both sides from its mouth to 31&deg;
north latitude. The United States acquired by the Louisiana purchase
of 1803 all the sovereignty of Spain which had previously
been acquired by France.</p>

<p>Gallatin proposed to insert a provision for the renewal to the
United States of the rights in the fisheries, and as an equivalent to
give to Great Britain the right to the navigation of the Mississippi
River. This was favored by Gallatin, Adams, and Bayard, and
opposed by Clay and Russell. Mr. Clay, seeing that he was in a
minority, stated that he would affix his name to no treaty which
contained such a provision. After his firm stand Mr. Bayard left the
majority. Clay's "obstinacy" in opposing concessions is well shown
in Mr. Adams's Journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To this last article [the right of the British to navigate the Mississippi
River] Mr. Clay makes strong objections. He is willing to leave the matter
of the fisheries as a nest-egg for another war.... He considers it a
privilege much too important to be conceded for the mere liberty of drying
fish upon a desert, but the Mississippi was destined to form a most important
part of the interests of the American Union.... Mr. Clay, of all the
members, had alone been urgent to present an article stipulating the abolition
of impressment. Mr. Clay lost his temper, as he generally does whenever
the right of the British to navigate the Mississippi is discussed....</p>

<p>"December 11th. He [Clay] was for war three years longer. He had no
doubt but three years more of war would make us a warlike people, and
that then we should come out of the war with honor.... December 22d.
At last he turned to me, and asked me whether I would not join him now
and break off negotiations."</p>

<p>After five months of weary negotiations under most adverse conditions
so far as the American commissioners were concerned, the
treaty was signed on December 24th, 1814. During all these months
Clay had resisted any and all concessions, and none were made.
The Marquis of Wellesley declared in the House of Lords that the
American commissioners had shown a most astonishing superiority
over the British during the whole of the correspondence.</p>

<p>During Mr. Clay's absence at Ghent, his admiring constituents
returned him to Congress by an almost unanimous vote. A year<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3766]</span>
later in Congress, Clay referred to his part in the bringing on the
war as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I gave a vote for a declaration of war. I exerted all the little influence
and talent I could command to make the war. The war was made. It is
terminated. And I declare with perfect sincerity, if it had been permitted
to me to lift the veil of futurity and to foresee the precise series of events
which had occurred, my vote would have been unchanged. We had been
insulted and outraged and spoliated upon by almost all Europe,&mdash;by Great
Britain, by France, Spain, Denmark, Naples, and to cap the climax, by the
little contemptible power of Algiers. We had submitted too long and too
much. We had become the scorn of foreign powers and the derision of our
own citizens. What have we gained by the war? Let any man look at the
degraded condition of this country before the war, the scorn of the universe,
the contempt of ourselves; and tell me if we have gained nothing by the
war? What is our situation now? Respectability and character abroad,
security and confidence at home."</p>

<p>Clay more than any other man forced the war. It was the successful
military hero of this war&mdash;the victor of New Orleans&mdash;who
defeated him in after years for the Presidency.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Missouri Compromise</span></h4>

<p>The heated struggle in Congress over the admission of Missouri
into the Union first brought prominently forward the agitation of the
slavery question. This struggle, which lasted from 1818 to 1821,
threatened the very existence of the Union. Jefferson wrote from
Monticello:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Missouri question is the most portentous one that has ever threatened
the Union. In the gloomiest moments of the Revolutionary War I
never had any apprehension equal to that I feel from this source."</p>

<p>Mr. Schurz, writing of the feeling at the time, says:&mdash;</p>


<p>"While thus the thought of dissolving the Union occurred readily to the
Southern mind, the thought of maintaining the government and preserving
the Union by means of force hardly occurred to anybody. It seemed to be
taken for granted on all sides that if the Southern States insisted on cutting
loose from the Union, nothing could be done but to let them go."</p>

<p>The two sections were at this time so evenly balanced that the
maintenance of the Union by force could not have been successfully
attempted. The compromise which admitted Missouri to the Union
as a slave State, and recognized the right of settlers to carry slaves
into the territory south of 36&deg; 30', was carried through by the
splendid leadership of Clay, who thus earned the title of "the great<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3767]</span>
pacificator." Future historians will accord to him the title of the
savior of the Union.</p>

<p>Upon the adoption of the compromise measures Mr. Clay resigned
his seat in Congress to give his attention to his private affairs, being
financially embarrassed by indorsing for a friend. During his stay at
home there was a fierce controversy over the issue of paper money
and relief measures to favor debtors who had become involved
through the recklessness following such inflation. Against what
seemed to be an overwhelming popular feeling, Clay arrayed himself
on the side of sound money and sound finance. In 1823 he was
again returned to the House of Representatives without opposition,
and was chosen Speaker by a vote of 139 to 42.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Internal Improvements</span></h4>

<p>Soon after his entrance into Congress Clay took advanced ground
in favor of building roads, improving water-ways, and constructing
canals by the general government, in order to connect the seaboard
States with the "boundless empire" of the growing West. He
became the leader, the foremost champion, of a system which was
bitterly opposed by some of the ablest statesmen of the time as
unauthorized by the Constitution. Clay triumphed, and during his
long public service was the recognized leader of a system which
though opposed at first, has been accepted as a national policy by
both of the great political parties. That he was actuated by a grand
conception of the future destiny of the country, and the needs of
such improvements to insure a more perfect union, his able speeches
on these questions will show. In one he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Every man who looks at the Constitution in the spirit to entitle him to
the character of statesman, must elevate his views to the height to which this
nation is destined to reach in the rank of nations. We are not legislating for
this moment only, or for the present generation, or for the present populated
limits of the United States; but our acts must embrace a wider scope,&mdash;reaching
northward to the Pacific and southwardly to the river Del Norte.
Imagine this extent of territory with sixty or seventy or a hundred millions
of people. The powers which exist now will exist then; and those which will
exist then exist now.... What was the object of the Convention in
framing the Constitution? The leading object was <span class="smcap">Union</span>,&mdash;Union, then peace.
Peace external and internal, and commerce, but more particularly union and
peace, the great objects of the framers of the Constitution, should be kept
steadily in view in the interpretation of any clause of it; and when it is susceptible
of various interpretation, that construction should be preferred which
tends to promote the objects of the framers of the Constitution, to the consolidation
of the Union.... No man deprecates more than I do the idea
of consolidation; yet between separation and consolidation, painful as would
be the alternative, I should greatly prefer the latter."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3768]</span></p>
<p>Congress now appropriates yearly for internal improvements a
sum far greater than the entire revenue of the government at the
time Clay made this speech.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Spanish-American Independence</span></h4>

<p>It was but natural that Clay's ardent nature and his love of liberty
would incline him to aid the people of Central and South America
in their efforts to free themselves from Spanish oppression and misrule.
Effective here as in all things undertaken by him, his name
must always be linked with the cause of Southern American independence.
Richard Rush, writing from London to Clay in 1825, says:
"The South-Americans owe to you, more than to any other man of
either hemisphere, their independence." His speeches, translated
into Spanish, were read to the revolutionary armies, and "his name
was a household name among the patriots." Bolivar, writing to him
from Bogot&aacute; in 1827, says:&mdash;"All America, Colombia, and myself,
owe your Excellency our purest gratitude for the incomparable services
which you have rendered to us, by sustaining our cause with
sublime enthusiasm."</p>

<p>In one of his speeches on this subject Clay foreshadows a great
American Zollverein. The failure of the Spanish-American republics
to attain the high ideals hoped for by Clay caused him deep regret
in after years.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The American System</span></h4>

<p>The tariff law of 1824 was another triumph of Clay's successful
leadership, since which time he has been called the father of what
has been termed the "American System." It must be remembered
that Clay was first led to propose protective duties in order to prepare
this country for a war which he felt could not be avoided without
loss of national honor. When in 1824 he advocated increased tariff
duties in order to foster home industries, protection was universal;
even our agricultural products were excluded from British markets by
the Corn Laws. The man who would now advocate in Congress
duties as low as those levied by the tariff law of 1824, would be called
by protectionists of the present day a free-trader. When in 1833
nullification of the tariff laws was threatened, Clay, while demanding
that the laws should be enforced and that if necessary nullification
should be put down by the strong arm of the government, feared
that the growing discontent of the South and the obstinacy of a military
President threatened the Union, introduced and carried to a
conclusion a compromise tariff measure that brought peace to the
country.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3769]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Secretary of State</span></h4>

<p>It was unfortunate that Clay temporarily relinquished his leadership
in Congress to accept the premiership in the Cabinet of President
Adams. Although the exacting official duties were not congenial, and
proved injurious to his health, his administration of this high office
was brilliant and able, as is well attested by the number of important
treaties concluded, and by his brilliant state papers. His instructions
to the United States delegates to the Panama Congress of American
Republics will grow in importance in the years to come, because of
the broad principles there enunciated,&mdash;that private property should
be exempt from seizure on the high seas in times of war.</p>

<p>His chivalrous loyalty to President Adams was fully appreciated,
and his friendship reciprocated. After the close of his administration
Mr. Adams in a speech said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to my motives for tendering him the Department of State when I
did, let the man who questions them come forward. Let him look around
among the statesmen and legislators of the nation and of that day. Let him
select and name the man whom, by his pre-eminent talents, by his splendid
services, by his ardent patriotism, by his all-embracing public spirit, by his
fervid eloquence in behalf of the rights and liberties of mankind, by his long
experience in the affairs of the Union, foreign and domestic, a President of
the United States intent only upon the honor and welfare of his country
ought to have preferred to Henry Clay."</p>

<p>Just before the close of his administration President Adams offered
him a position on the bench of the Supreme Court, which he
declined.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">His Position on African Slavery</span></h4>

<p>Clay was a slaveholder, a kind master&mdash;but through his entire
public life an open advocate of emancipation. He probably received
his early predilections against slavery from his association with
Chancellor Wythe, before removing from Virginia, as indeed the
best part of his education probably came from personal contact with
that able man. The intellectual forces of the border slave States
were arrayed in favor of emancipation, until, as Clay writes with some
feeling in 1849, they were driven to an opposite course "by the
violent and indiscreet course of ultra abolitionists in the North";
but Clay remained to his death hopeful that by peaceable means
his country might be rid of this great evil. In the letter above
quoted, writing of his failure to establish a system of gradual emancipation
in Kentucky, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3770]</span></p>
<p>"It is a consoling reflection that although a system of gradual emancipation
cannot be established, slavery is destined inevitably to extinction by the
operation of peaceful and natural causes. And it is also gratifying to believe
that there will not be probably much difference in the period of its existence,
whether it terminates legally or naturally. The chief difference in the two
modes is that according to the first, we should take hold of the institution
intelligently and dispose of it cautiously and safely; while according to the
other it will some day or other take hold of us, and constrain us in some
manner or other to get rid of it."</p>

<p>As early as 1798, he made his first political speeches in Kentucky
advocating an amendment to the State Constitution, providing for
the gradual emancipation of the slaves. Referring to the failure to
adopt this amendment, he said in a speech delivered in the capital
of Kentucky in 1829:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall never cease to regret a decision, the effects of which have been
to place us in the rear of our neighbors who are exempt from slavery, in the
state of agriculture, the progress of manufactures, the advance of improvements,
and the general progress of society."</p>

<p>In these days, when public men who should be leaders bend to
what they believe to be the popular wishes, the example of Clay, in
his bold disregard of the prejudices and property interests of his
constituents, is inspiring.</p>

<p>George W. Prentice was sent from New England to Kentucky to
write a life of Clay, and writing in 1830 he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whenever a slave brought an action at law for his liberty, Mr. Clay
volunteered as his advocate, and it is said that in the whole course of his
practice he never failed to obtain a verdict in the slave's favor.... He
has been the slaves' friend through life. In all stations he has pleaded the
cause of African freedom without fear from high or low. To him more than
to any other individual is to be ascribed the great revolution which has taken
place upon this subject&mdash;a revolution whose wheels must continue to move
onward till they reach the goal of universal freedom."</p>

<p>Three years before this was written, Clay in a speech before the
Colonization Society said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I could be instrumental in eradicating this deepest stain upon the
character of my country, and removing all cause of reproach on account of it
by foreign nations; if I could only be instrumental in ridding of this foul
blot that revered State which gave me birth, or that not less beloved State
which kindly adopted me as her son, I would not exchange the proud satisfaction
which I should enjoy for the honor of all the triumphs ever decreed
to the most successful conqueror."</p>

<p>He longed to add the imperial domain of Texas to this country,
but feared that it would so strengthen the slave power as to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3771]</span>
endanger the Union; and when finally he yielded to the inevitable,
the Free-Soilers threw their votes to Birney and thus defeated Clay
for the Presidency. He deprecated the war with Mexico, yet gave his
favorite son as a soldier, who fell at Buena Vista. He stood for the
reception of anti-slavery petitions by Congress, against the violent
opposition of the leading men of his own section. He continued
steadfast to the end, writing in 1849 that if slavery were, as claimed,
a blessing, "the principle on which it is maintained would require
that one portion of the white race should be reduced to bondage to
serve another portion of the same race, when black subjects of
slavery could not be obtained." He proposed reasonable schemes for
gradual emancipation and deportation, which would, if adopted, have
averted the war and settled peaceably the serious problem. He
warned the Southerners in 1849 that their demands were unreasonable,
and would "lead to the formation of a sectional Northern party,
which will sooner or later take permanent and exclusive possession
of the Government."</p>

<p>Seeming inconsistencies in Mr. Clay's record on this subject will
disappear with a full understanding of the difficulties of his position.
Living in a State midway between the North and South, where
slavery existed in its mildest and least objectionable form, yet fully
alive to its evils, recognizing that the grave problem requiring solution
was not alone slavery, but the presence among a free people of
a numerous, fecund, servile, alien race; realizing that one section of
the country, then relatively too powerful to be ignored, was ready to
withdraw from the Union rather than to submit to laws that would
endanger slavery; loving the Union with an ardor not excelled by
that of any public man in our history; wishing and striving for the
emancipation of the slaves, yet too loyal to the Union to follow the
more zealous advocates of freedom in their "higher law than the
Constitution" crusade,&mdash;Mr. Clay in his whole course on this question
was consistent and patriotic in the highest degree.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Compromise of 1850</span></h4>

<p>The crowning triumph of a long life of great achievements was
his great compromise measures of 1850. These, with their predecessors
of 1821 and 1833, have caused some writers to speak of Clay as
a man of compromising nature. The reverse is true. Bold, aggressive,
uncompromising, and often dictatorial by nature, he favored
compromise when convinced that only by such means could civil
war or a disruption of the Union be averted. And he was right.
He averted a conflict or separation from the Union when the relative
strength of the South was such as to have rendered impossible the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3772]</span>
preservation of the Union by force. The Constitution was a compromise,
without which there would have been no union of States.
That the compromise did not long survive him was no fault of
Clay's, but chargeable to the agitators of both sections, who cared
less for the Union than for their pet theories or selfish interests.</p>

<p>Two years after his death the compromise measures were repealed,
and the most destructive civil war of modern times and a long list of
resultant evils are the result. Those who knew Henry Clay and had
felt his wonderful power as a leader, are firm in the belief that had
he been alive and in the possession of his faculties in 1861, the Civil
War would have been averted. His name and the memory of his love
for the Union restrained his adopted State from joining the South.</p>

<p>The struggle over the passage of the compromise measures, lasting
for seven months, was one of the most memorable parliamentary
struggles on record. The old hero, Henry Clay, broken in health,
with the stamp of death upon him, for six weary months led the
fight with much of his old-time fire and ability. Sustained by
indomitable will and supreme love of country, "I am here," he said,
"expecting soon to go hence, and owing no responsibility but to my
own conscience and to God."</p>

<p>In his opening speech, which lasted for two days, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I owe it to myself to say that no earthly power could induce me to vote
for a specific measure for the introduction of slavery where it had not before
existed, either south or north of that line. Sir, while you reproach, and
justly too, our British ancestors for the introduction of this institution upon
the continent of America, I am for one unwilling that the posterity of the
present inhabitants of California and New Mexico shall reproach us for doing
just what we reproach Great Britain for doing to us."</p>

<p>He upbraided on the one hand the ultra abolitionists as reckless
agitators, and hurled defiance at disunionists of the South, while at
the same time appealing to the loftier nature and patriotic impulses
of his hearers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe from the bottom of my soul that this measure is the reunion
of the Union. And now let us discard all resentments, all passions, all petty
jealousies, all personal desires, all love of peace, all hungering after gilded
crumbs which fall from the table of power. Let us forget popular fears,
from whatever quarter they may spring. Let us go to the fountain of unadulterated
patriotism, and performing a solemn lustration, return divested of
all selfish, sinister, and sordid impurities, and think alone of our God, our
country, our conscience, and our glorious Union."</p>

<p>As described by Bancroft, Clay was "in stature over six feet,
spare and long-limbed; he stood erect as if full of vigor and vitality,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3773]</span>
and ever ready to command. His countenance expressed perpetual
wakefulness and activity. His voice was music itself, and yet penetrating
and far-reaching, enchanting the listeners; his words flowed
rapidly without sing-song or mannerism, in a clear and steady stream.
Neither in public nor in private did he know how to be dull."</p>

<p>Bold, fearless, commanding, the lordliest leader of his day, he was
yet gentle, and as an old friend wrote, "was the most emotional man
I ever knew. I have seen his eyes fill instantly on shaking the hand
of an old friend, however obscure, who had stood by him in his early
struggles." The manliest of men, yet his voice would tremble with
emotion on reading aloud from a letter the love messages from a
little grandchild.</p>

<p>The following, told me by a gentleman who knew Mr. Clay, illustrates
the true gentleman he was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I was a small boy my father took me with him to visit Mr. Clay
at his home Ashland. We found some gentlemen there who had been invited
to dinner. Just before they went in to dinner my father told me privately to
run out and play on the lawn while they were dining. As the gentlemen
came out, Mr. Clay saw me, and calling me to him said, 'My young friend,
I owe you an apology.' Turning to the gentlemen he said, 'Go into the
library, gentlemen, and light your cigars&mdash;I will join you presently.' Taking
me by the hand he returned with me to the table, ordered the servants to
attend to my wants, and conversed most delightfully with me until I had finished
my dinner."</p>

<p>He had the faculty of making friends and holding them through
life by ties which no circumstances or conditions could sever.</p>

<p>When Clay passed away there was no one whose Unionism embraced
all sections, who could stand between the over-zealous advocates
of abolition of slavery on the one side and the fiery defenders
of the "divine institution" on the other. Sectionalism ran riot, and
civil war was the result. During the many years when the North
and South were divided on the question of slavery, and sectional
feeling ran high, Henry Clay was the only man in public life whose
broad nationalism and intense love for the Union embraced all sections,

<h3><a name="PUBLIC_SPIRIT_IN_POLITICS" id="PUBLIC_SPIRIT_IN_POLITICS"></a>PUBLIC SPIRIT IN POLITICS</h3>

<h4>From a Speech at Buffalo, July 17th, 1839</h4>

<p>Are we not then called upon by the highest duties to our
country, to its free institutions, to posterity, and to the
world, to rise above all local prejudices and personal partialities,
to discard all collateral questions, to disregard every
subordinate point, and in a genuine spirit of compromise and
concession, uniting heart and hand to preserve for ourselves the
blessings of a free government, wisely, honestly, and faithfully
administered, and as we received them from our fathers, to
transmit them to our children? Should we not justly subject
ourselves to eternal reproach, if we permitted our differences
about mere men to bring defeat and disaster upon our cause?
Our principles are imperishable, but men have but a fleeting
existence, and are themselves liable to change and corruption
during its brief continuance.</p>

<h3><a name="GREEK_STRUGGLE" id="GREEK_STRUGGLE"></a>ON THE GREEK STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE</h3>

<h4>From a Speech in 1824</h4>

<p>Are we so mean, so base, so despicable, that we may not
attempt to express our horror, utter our indignation, at
the most brutal and atrocious war that ever stained earth
or shocked high Heaven? at the ferocious deeds of a savage and
infuriated soldiery, stimulated and urged on by the clergy of a
fanatical and inimical religion, and rioting in all the excesses of
blood and butchery, at the mere details of which the heart sickens
and recoils?</p>

<p>If the great body of Christendom can look on calmly and
coolly while all this is perpetrated on a Christian people, in its
own immediate vicinity, in its very presence, let us at least
evince that one of its remote extremities is susceptible of sensibility
to Christian wrongs, and capable of sympathy for Christian
sufferings; that in this remote quarter of the world there
are hearts not yet closed against compassion for human woes,
that can pour out their indignant feelings at the oppression
of a people endeared to us by every ancient recollection and
every modern tie. Sir, attempts have been made to alarm the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3775]</span>
committee by the dangers to our commerce in the Mediterranean;
and a wretched invoice of figs and opium has been
spread before us to repress our sensibilities and to eradicate our
humanity. Ah, sir! "What shall it profit a man if he gain the
whole world and lose his own soul?" or what shall it avail a
nation to save the whole of a miserable trade and lose its liberties?</p>

<h3><a name="SOUTH-AMERICAN_INDEPENDENCE" id="SOUTH-AMERICAN_INDEPENDENCE"></a>SOUTH-AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE AS RELATED TO THE
UNITED STATES</h3>

<h4>From a Speech before the House of Representatives in 1818</h4>

<p>It is the doctrine of thrones that man is too ignorant to govern
himself. Their partisans assert his incapacity, in reference
to all nations; if they cannot command universal assent
to the proposition, it is then demanded as to particular nations;
and our pride and our presumption too often make converts of
us. I contend that it is to arraign the dispositions of Providence
himself, to suppose that he has created beings incapable of
governing themselves, and to be trampled on by kings. Self-government
is the natural government of man, and for proof I
refer to the aborigines of our own land. Were I to speculate in
hypotheses unfavorable to human liberty, my speculations should
be founded rather upon the vices, refinements, or density of
population. Crowded together in compact masses, even if they
were philosophers, the contagion of the passions is communicated
and caught, and the effect too often, I admit, is the overthrow
of liberty. Dispersed over such an immense space as that
on which the people of Spanish America are spread, their physical
and I believe also their moral condition both favor their
liberty.</p>

<p>With regard to their superstition, they worship the same God
with us. Their prayers are offered up in their temples to the
same Redeemer whose intercession we expect to save us. Nor
is there anything in the Catholic religion unfavorable to freedom.
All religions united with government are more or less
inimical to liberty. All separated from government are compatible
with liberty. If the people of Spanish America have not
already gone as far in religious toleration as we have, the difference
in their condition from ours should not be forgotten.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3776]</span>
Everything is progressive; and in time I hope to see them imitating
in this respect our example. But grant that the people
of Spanish America are ignorant, and incompetent for free government;
to whom is that ignorance to be ascribed? Is it not
to the execrable system of Spain, which she seeks again to
establish and to perpetuate? So far from chilling our hearts, it
ought to increase our solicitude for our unfortunate brethren.
It ought to animate us to desire the redemption of the minds
and bodies of unborn millions from the brutifying effects of a
system whose tendency is to stifle the faculties of the soul, and
to degrade them to the level of beasts. I would invoke the
spirits of our departed fathers. Was it for yourselves only that
you nobly fought? No, no! It was the chains that were forging
for your posterity that made you fly to arms; and scattering
the elements of these chains to the winds, you transmitted to us
the rich inheritance of liberty.</p>

<h3><a name="VALEDICTORY_TO_THE_SENATE" id="VALEDICTORY_TO_THE_SENATE"></a>FROM THE VALEDICTORY TO THE SENATE, DELIVERED IN 1842</h3>

<p>From 1806, the period of my entrance upon this noble theatre,
with short intervals, to the present time, I have been
engaged in the public councils at home or abroad. Of
the services rendered during that long and arduous period of
my life it does not become me to speak; history, if she deign
to notice me, and posterity, if the recollection of my humble
actions shall be transmitted to posterity, are the best, the truest,
and the most impartial judges. When death has closed the
scene, their sentence will be pronounced, and to that I commit
myself. My public conduct is a fair subject for the criticism
and judgment of my fellow men; but the motives by which I
have been prompted are known only to the great Searcher of
the human heart and to myself; and I trust I may be pardoned
for repeating a declaration made some thirteen years ago, that
whatever errors&mdash;and doubtless there have been many&mdash;may
be discovered in a review of my public service, I can with
unshaken confidence appeal to that divine Arbiter for the truth
of the declaration that I have been influenced by no impure
purpose, no personal motive; have sought no personal aggrandizement;
but that in all my public acts I have had a single
eye directed and a warm and devoted heart dedicated to what,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3777]</span>
in my best judgment, I believed the true interests, the honor,
the union, and the happiness of my country required.</p>

<p>During that long period, however, I have not escaped the
fate of other public men, nor failed to incur censure and detraction
of the bitterest, most unrelenting, and most malignant
character; and though not always insensible to the pain it was
meant to inflict, I have borne it in general with composure and
without disturbance, waiting as I have done, in perfect and
undoubting confidence, for the ultimate triumph of justice and
of truth, and in the entire persuasion that time would settle all
things as they should be; and that whatever wrong or injustice
I might experience at the hands of man, He to whom all hearts
are open and fully known, would by the inscrutable dispensations
of His providence rectify all error, redress all wrong, and
cause ample justice to be done.</p>

<p>But I have not meanwhile been unsustained. Everywhere
throughout the extent of this great continent I have had cordial,
warm-hearted, faithful, and devoted friends, who have
known me, loved me, and appreciated my motives. To them, if
language were capable of fully expressing my acknowledgments,
I would now offer all the return I have the power to make for
their genuine, disinterested, and persevering fidelity and devoted
attachment, the feelings and sentiments of a heart overflowing
with never-ceasing gratitude. If, however, I fail in suitable language
to express my gratitude to them for all the kindness they
have shown me, what shall I say, what can I say, at all commensurate
with those feelings of gratitude with which I have been
inspired by the State whose humble representative and servant I
have been in this chamber?</p>

<p>I emigrated from Virginia to the State of Kentucky now
nearly forty-five years ago; I went as an orphan boy who had
not yet attained the age of majority; who had never recognized
a father's smile, nor felt his warm caresses; poor, penniless,
without the favor of the great, with an imperfect and neglected
education, hardly sufficient for the ordinary business and common
pursuits of life; but scarce had I set my foot upon her
generous soil when I was embraced with parental fondness,
caressed as though I had been a favorite child, and patronized
with liberal and unbounded munificence. From that period the
highest honors of the State have been freely bestowed upon
me; and when in the darkest hour of calumny and detraction<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3778]</span>
I seemed to be assailed by all the rest of the world, she interposed
her broad and impenetrable shield, repelled the poisoned
shafts that were aimed for my destruction, and vindicated my
good name from every malignant and unfounded aspersion. I
return with indescribable pleasure to linger a while longer, and
mingle with the warm-hearted and whole-souled people of that
State; and when the last scene shall forever close upon me, I
hope that my earthly remains will be laid under her green sod
with those of her gallant and patriotic sons....</p>

<p>That my nature is warm, my temper ardent, my disposition&mdash;especially
in relation to the public service&mdash;enthusiastic, I am
ready to own; and those who suppose that I have been assuming
the dictatorship, have only mistaken for arrogance or assumption
that ardor and devotion which are natural to my constitution,
and which I may have displayed with too little regard to cold,
calculating, and cautious prudence, in sustaining and zealously
supporting important national measures of policy which I have
presented and espoused....</p>

<p>I go from this place under the hope that we shall mutually
consign to perpetual oblivion whatever personal collisions may at
any time unfortunately have occurred between us; and that our
recollections shall dwell in future only on those conflicts of mind
with mind, those intellectual struggles, those noble exhibitions of
the powers of logic, argument, and eloquence, honorable to the
Senate and to the nation, in which each has sought and contended
for what he deemed the best mode of accomplishing one
common object, the interest and the most happiness of our
beloved country. To these thrilling and delightful scenes it will
be my pleasure and my pride to look back in my retirement
with unmeasured satisfaction....</p>

<p>May the most precious blessings of Heaven rest upon the
whole Senate and each member of it, and may the labors of
every one redound to the benefit of the nation and to the
advancement of his own fame and renown. And when you shall
retire to the bosom of your constituents, may you receive the
most cheering and gratifying of all human rewards,&mdash;their cordial
greeting of "Well done, good and faithful servant."</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_THE_LEXINGTON_SPEECH_ON_RETIREMENT_TO" id="FROM_THE_LEXINGTON_SPEECH_ON_RETIREMENT_TO"></a>FROM THE LEXINGTON 'SPEECH ON RETIREMENT TO
PRIVATE LIFE'</h3>

<p>It would neither be fitting, nor is it my purpose, to pass judgment
on all the acts of my public life; but I hope I shall
be excused for one or two observations which the occasion
appears to me to authorize.</p>

<p>I never but once changed my opinion on any great measure
of national policy, or on any great principle of construction of
the national Constitution. In early life, on deliberate consideration,
I adopted the principles of interpreting the federal Constitution
which have been so ably developed and enforced by Mr.
Madison in his memorable report to the Virginia Legislature;
and to them, as I understood them, I have constantly adhered.
Upon the question coming up in the Senate of the United States
to re-charter the first Bank of the United States, thirty years
ago, I opposed the re-charter upon convictions which I honestly
entertained. The experience of the war which shortly followed,
the condition into which the currency of the country was thrown
without a bank, and I may now add, later and more disastrous
experience, convinced me I was wrong. I publicly stated to
my constituents, in a speech in Lexington (that which I made
in the House of Representatives of the United States not having
been reported), my reasons for that change, and they are
preserved in the archives of the country. I appeal to that
record, and I am willing to be judged now and hereafter by
their validity.</p>

<p>I do not advert to the fact of this solitary instance of change
of opinion as implying any personal merit, but because it is a
fact. I will however say that I think it very perilous to the
utility of any public man to make frequent changes of opinion,
or any change, but upon grounds so sufficient and palpable that
the public can clearly see and approve them. If we could look
through a window into the human breast and there discover the
causes which led to changes of opinion, they might be made
without hazard. But as it is impossible to penetrate the human
heart and distinguish between the sinister and honest motives
which prompt it, any public man that changes his opinion, once
deliberately formed and promulgated, under other circumstances
than those which I have stated, draws around him distrust,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3780]</span>
impairs the public confidence, and lessens his capacity to serve
his country.</p>

<p>I will take this occasion now to say, that I am and have been
long satisfied that it would have been wiser and more politic in
me to have declined accepting the office of Secretary of State
in 1825. Not that my motives were not as pure and as patriotic
as ever carried any man into public office. Not that the calumny
which was applied to the fact was not as gross and as unfounded
as any that was ever propagated. Not that valued friends and
highly esteemed opponents did not unite in urging my acceptance
of the office. Not that the administration of Mr. Adams
will not, I sincerely believe, advantageously compare with any
of his predecessors, in economy, purity, prudence, and wisdom.
Not that Mr. Adams was himself wanting in any of those high
qualifications and upright and patriotic intentions which were
suited to the office....</p>

<p>But my error in accepting the office arose out of my under
rating the power of detraction and the force of ignorance, and
abiding with too sure a confidence in the conscious integrity
and uprightness of my own motives. Of that ignorance I had a
remarkable and laughable example on an occasion which I will
relate. I was traveling in 1828 through&mdash;I believe it was
Spottsylvania County in Virginia, on my return to Washington,
in company with some young friends. We halted at night at a
tavern, kept by an aged gentleman who, I quickly perceived
from the disorder and confusion which reigned, had not the
happiness to have a wife. After a hurried and bad supper the
old gentleman sat down by me, and without hearing my name,
but understanding that I was from Kentucky, remarked that he
had four sons in that State, and that he was very sorry they
were divided in politics, two being for Adams and two for Jackson;
he wished they were all for Jackson. "Why?" I asked
him.&mdash;"Because," he said, "that fellow Clay, and Adams, had
cheated Jackson out of the Presidency."&mdash;"Have you ever seen
any evidence, my old friend," said I, "of that?"&mdash;"No," he
replied, "none," and he wanted to see none. "But," I observed,
looking him directly and steadily in the face, "suppose Mr. Clay
were to come here and assure you upon his honor that it was
all a vile calumny, and not a word of truth in it, would you
believe him?"&mdash;"No," replied the old gentleman, promptly and
emphatically. I said to him in conclusion, "Will you be good<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3781]</span>
enough to show me to bed?" and bade him good-night. The
next morning, having in the interval learned my name, he
came to me full of apologies; but I at once put him at his ease
by assuring him that I did not feel in the slightest degree hurt
or offended with him....</p>

<p>If to have served my country during a long series of years
with fervent zeal and unshaken fidelity, in seasons of peace and
war, at home and abroad, in the legislative halls and in an
executive department; if to have labored most sedulously to
avert the embarrassment and distress which now overspread this
Union, and when they came, to have exerted myself anxiously
at the extra session, and at this, to devise healing remedies; if
to have desired to introduce economy and reform in the general
administration, curtail enormous executive power, and amply
provide at the same time for the wants of the government and
the wants of the people, by a tariff which would give it revenue
and then protection; if to have earnestly sought to establish the
bright but too rare example of a party in power faithful to its
promises and pledges made when out of power: if these services,
exertions, and endeavors justify the accusation of ambition, I
must plead guilty to the charge.</p>

<p>I have wished the good opinion of the world; but I defy the
most malignant of my enemies to show that I have attempted to
gain it by any low or groveling arts, by any mean or unworthy
sacrifices, by the violation of any of the obligations of honor, or
by a breach of any of the duties which I owed to my country....</p>

<p>How is this right of the people to abolish an existing government,
and to set up a new one, to be practically exercised?
Our revolutionary ancestors did not tell us by words, but they
proclaimed it by gallant and noble deeds. Who are the people
that are to tear up the whole fabric of human society, whenever
and as often as caprice or passion may prompt them? When
all the arrangements and ordinances of existing organized society
are prostrated and subverted, as must be supposed in such a
lawless and irregular movement as that in Rhode Island, the
established privileges and distinctions between the sexes, between
the colors, between the ages, between natives and foreigners,
between the sane and the insane, and between the innocent and
the guilty convict, all the offspring of positive institutions, are cast
down and abolished, and society is thrown into one heterogeneous
and unregulated mass. And is it contended that the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3782]</span>
major part of this Babel congregation is invested with the right
to build up at its pleasure a new government? that as often,
and whenever, society can be drummed up and thrown into
such a shapeless mass, the major part of it may establish another
and another new government in endless succession? Why, this
would overturn all social organization, make revolutions&mdash;the
extreme and last resort of an oppressed people&mdash;the commonest
occurrences of human life, and the standing order of the day.
How such a principle would operate in a certain section of this
Union, with a peculiar population, you will readily conceive.
No community could endure such an intolerable state of things
anywhere, and all would sooner or later take refuge from such
ceaseless agitation in the calm repose of absolute despotism....</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens of all parties! The present situation of our
country is one of unexampled distress and difficulty; but
there is no occasion for any despondency. A kind and bountiful
Providence has never deserted us; punished us he perhaps has,
for our neglect of his blessings and our misdeeds. We have a
varied and fertile soil, a genial climate, and free institutions.
Our whole land is covered in profusion with the means of subsistence
and the comforts of life. Our gallant ship, it is unfortunately
true, lies helpless, tossed on a tempestuous sea amid
the conflicting billows of contending parties, without a rudder
and without a faithful pilot. But that ship is our country,
embodying all our past glory, all our future hopes. Its crew is
our whole people, by whatever political denomination they are
known. If she goes down, we all go down together. Let us
remember the dying words of the gallant and lamented Lawrence,
"Don't give up the ship." The glorious banner of our
country, with its unstained stars and stripes, still proudly floats
at its mast-head. With stout hearts and strong arms we can
surmount all our difficulties. Let us all, all, rally round that
banner, and finally resolve to perpetuate our liberties and regain
our lost prosperity.</p>

<p>Whigs! Arouse from the ignoble supineness which encompasses
you; awake from the lethargy in which you lie bound;
cast from you that unworthy apathy which seems to make you
indifferent to the fate of your country. Arouse! awake! shake
off the dewdrops that glitter on your garments, and once more
march to battle and to victory. You have been disappointed,
deceived, betrayed; shamefully deceived and betrayed. But will<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3783]</span>
you therefore also prove false and faithless to your country, or
obey the impulses of a just and patriotic indignation? As for
Captain Tyler, he is a mere snap, a flash in the pan; pick your
Whig flints and try your rifles again.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">leanthes, the immediate successor of Zeno, the founder of
Stoicism, was born at Assos, in the Troad, in B.C. 331. Of
his early life we know nothing, except that he was for a
time a prize-fighter. About the age of thirty he came to Athens
with less than a dollar in his pocket, and entered the school of Zeno,
where he remained for some nineteen years. At one time the Court
of Areopagus, not seeing how he could make an honest livelihood,
summoned him to appear before it and give an account of himself.
He did so, bringing with him his employers, who proved that he
spent much of the night in carrying water for gardens, or in kneading
dough. The court, filled with admiration, offered him a pension,
which he refused by the advice of his master, who thought the practice
of self-dependence and strong endurance an essential part of
education. Cleanthes's mind was slow of comprehension but extremely
retentive; like a hard tablet, Zeno said, which retains clearest and
longest what is written on it. He was not an original thinker, but
the strength and loftiness of his character and his strong religious
sense gave him an authority which no other member of the school
could claim. For many years head of the Stoa, he reached the
ripe age of ninety-nine, when, falling sick, he refused to take food,
and died of voluntary starvation in B.C. 232. Long afterwards, the
Roman Senate caused a statue to be erected to his memory in his
native town. Almost the only writing of his that has come down to
us is his noble Hymn to the Supreme Being.</p>

<h4>(1835-)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/caps.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="S" title="S" />
</div><p class="dropcap">amuel L. Clemens has made the name he assumed in his
earliest "sketches" for newspapers so completely to usurp
his own in public and private, that until recently the world
knew him by no other; his world of admirers rarely use any other in
referring to the great author, and even to his intimate friends the
borrowed name seems the more real. The pseudonym so lightly
picked up has nearly universal recognition, and it is safe to say that
the name "Mark Twain" is known to more people of all conditions,
the world over, than any other in this century, except that of some
reigning sovereign or great war captain. The term is one used by
the Mississippi River pilots to indicate the depth of water (two
fathoms) when throwing the lead. It was first employed by a river
correspondent in reporting the state of the river to a New Orleans
newspaper. This reporter died just about the time Mr. Clemens
began to write, and he "jumped" the name.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens was born in Hannibal, Missouri, a small town on the
west bank of the Mississippi, in 1835. He got the rudiments of an
education at a village school, learned boy-life and human nature in a
frontier community, entered a printing office and became an expert
compositor, traveled and worked as a journeyman printer, and at
length reached the summit of a river boy's ambition in a Mississippi
steamboat in learning the business of a pilot. It is to this experience
that the world is indebted for some of the most amusing, the most
real and valuable, and the most imaginative writing of this century,
which gives the character and interest and individuality to this great
Western river that history has given to the Nile. If he had no other
title to fame, he could rest securely on his reputation as the prose
poet of the Mississippi. Upon the breaking out of the war the river
business was suspended. Mr. Clemens tried the occupation of war
for a few weeks, on the Confederate side, in a volunteer squad which
does not seem to have come into collision with anything but scant
rations and imaginary alarms; and then he went to Nevada with his
brother, who had been appointed secretary of that Territory. Here
he became connected with the Territorial Enterprise, a Virginia City
newspaper, as a reporter and sketch-writer, and immediately opened
a battery of good-natured and exaggerated and complimentary description
that was vastly amusing to those who were not its targets.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3788]</span>
Afterwards he drifted to the Coast, tried mining, and then joined that
group of young writers who illustrated the early history of California.
A short voyage in the Sandwich Islands gave him new material for
his pen, and he made a successful d&eacute;but in San Francisco as a
humorous lecturer.</p>

<p>The first writing to attract general attention was 'The Jumping
Frog of Calaveras,' which was republished with several other
sketches in book form in New York. Shortly after this he joined
the excursion of the Quaker City steamship to the Orient, wrote letters
about it to American newspapers, and advertised it quite beyond
the expectations of its projectors. These letters, collected and revised,
became 'The Innocents Abroad,' which instantly gave him a
world-wide reputation. This was followed by 'Roughing It,' most
amusing episodes of frontier life. His pen became immediately in
great demand, and innumerable sketches flowed from it, many of them
recklessly exaggerated for the effect he wished to produce; always
laughter-provoking, and nearly always having a wholesome element
of satire of some sham or pretense or folly. For some time he had
charge of a humorous department in the Galaxy Magazine. These
sketches and others that followed were from time to time collected
into volumes which had a great sale. About this time he married,
and permanently settled in Hartford, where he began the collection
of a library, set himself to biographical and historical study, made
incursions into German and French, and prepared himself for the
more serious work that was before him.</p>

<p>A second sojourn in Europe produced 'A Tramp Abroad,' full of
stories and adventures, much in the spirit of his original effort. But
with more reading, reflection, and search into his own experiences,
came 'Old Times on the Mississippi,' 'Tom Sawyer,' and 'Huckleberry
Finn,' in which the author wrote out of his own heart. To
interest in social problems must be attributed the beautiful idyl of
'The Prince and the Pauper,' and 'The Yankee at the Court of King
Arthur,' which latter the English thought lacked reverence for the
traditions of chivalry.</p>

<p>During all this period Mr. Clemens was in great demand as a lecturer
and an after-dinner speaker. His remarks about New England
weather, at a New England dinner in New York, are a favorite example
of his humor and his power of poetic description. As a lecturer,
a teller of stories, and delineator of character, he had scarcely a
rival in his ability to draw and entertain vast audiences. He made
a large income from his lectures in America and in England, and
from his books, which always had a phenomenally large sale. Very
remunerative also was the play of 'Colonel Sellers,' constructed out
of a novel called 'The Gilded Age.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3789]</span></p>
<p>Since 1890 Mr. Clemens and his family have lived most of the
time in Europe. For some time before he had written little, but
since that his pen has again become active. He has produced many
magazine papers, a story called 'Pudd'nhead Wilson,' and the most
serious and imaginative work of his life in 'The Personal Recollections
of Joan of Arc,' feigned to be translated from a contemporary
memoir left by her private secretary. In it the writer strikes the
universal chords of sympathy and pathos and heroic elevation. In
1895-6 he made a lecturing tour of the globe, speaking in Australia,
New Zealand, South Africa, and India, and everywhere received an
ovation due to his commanding reputation. He is understood to be
making this journey the subject of another book.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens is universally recognized as the first of living humorists;
but if the fashion of humor changes, as change it may, he will
remain for other qualities&mdash;certain primordial qualities such as are
exhibited in his work on the Mississippi&mdash;a force to be reckoned
with in the literature of this century. Mr. Clemens's humor has the
stamp of universality, which is the one indispensable thing in all
enduring literary productions, and his books have been translated
and very widely diffused and read in German, French, and other
languages. This is a prophecy of his lasting place in the world of
letters.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CHILD_OF_CALAMITY" id="THE_CHILD_OF_CALAMITY"></a>THE CHILD OF CALAMITY</h3>

<h4>From 'Life on the Mississippi': copyright 1883, by James R. Osgood and Company</h4>

<p>By way of illustrating keelboat talk and manners, and that
now departed and hardly remembered raft life, I will throw
in, in this place, a chapter from a book which I have been
working at by fits and starts during the past five or six years,
and may possibly finish in the course of five or six more. The
book is a story which details some passages in the life of an
ignorant village boy, Huck Finn, son of the town drunkard of
my time out West there. He has run away from his persecuting
father, and from a persecuting good widow who wishes to
make a nice truth-telling respectable boy of him; and with him
a slave of the widow's has also escaped. They have found a
fragment of a lumber raft (it is high water and dead summer-time),
and are floating down the river by night and hiding in
the willows by day,&mdash;bound for Cairo,&mdash;whence the negro will
seek freedom in the heart of the free States. But in a fog, they
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3790]</span>pass Cairo without knowing it. By-and-by they begin to suspect
the truth, and Huck Finn is persuaded to end the dismal
suspense by swimming down to a huge raft which they have
seen in the distance ahead of them, creeping aboard under cover
of the darkness, and gathering the needed information by eavesdropping:&mdash;</p>

<p>But you know a young person can't wait very well when he
is impatient to find a thing out. We talked it over, and by-and-by
Jim said it was such a black night now that it wouldn't be
no risk to swim down to the big raft and crawl aboard and
listen,&mdash;they would talk about Cairo, because they would be calculating
to go ashore there for a spree, maybe, or anyway they
would send boats ashore to buy whisky or fresh meat or something.
Jim had a wonderful level head, for a nigger: he could
'most always start a good plan when you wanted one.</p>

<p>I stood up and shook my rags off and jumped into the river,
and struck out for the raft's light. By-and-by, when I got down
nearly to her, I eased up and went slow and cautious. But
everything was all right&mdash;nobody at the sweeps. So I swum
down along the raft till I was 'most abreast the camp fire in the
middle, then I crawled aboard and inched along and got in
amongst some bundles of shingles on the weather side of the
fire. There was thirteen men there&mdash;they was the watch on
deck, of course. And a mighty rough-looking lot too. They
had a jug, and tin cups, and they kept the jug moving. One
man was singing&mdash;roaring, you may say; and it wasn't a nice
song&mdash;for a parlor anyway. He roared through his nose, and
strung out the last word of every line very long. When he was
done they all fetched a kind of Injun war-whoop, and then
another was sung. It begun:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was a woman in our towdn.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In our towdn did dwed'l (dwell),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She loved her husband dear-i-lee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But another man twyste as wed'l.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Singing too, riloo, riloo, riloo,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ri-loo, riloo, rilay&mdash;-e,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She loved her husband dear-i-lee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But another man twyste as wed'l."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so on&mdash;fourteen verses. It was kind of poor, and when he
was going to start on the next verse one of them said it was
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3791]</span>the tune the old cow died on; and another one said, "Oh, give
us a rest." And another one told him to take a walk. They
made fun of him till he got mad and jumped up and begun to
cuss the crowd, and said he could lam any thief in the lot.</p>

<p>They was all about to make a break for him, but the biggest
man there jumped up and says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Set whar you are, gentlemen. Leave him to me; he's my
meat."</p>

<p>Then he jumped up in the air three times and cracked his
heels together every time. He flung off a buckskin coat that
was all hung with fringes, and says, "You lay thar tell the
chawin-up's done;" and flung his hat down, which was all over
ribbons, and says, "You lay thar tell his sufferins is over."</p>

<p>Then he jumped up in the air and cracked his heels together
again and shouted out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whoo-oop! I'm the old original iron-jawed, brass-mounted,
copper-bellied corpse-maker from the wilds of Arkansaw!&mdash;Look
at me! I'm the man they call Sudden Death and General Desolation!
Sired by a hurricane, dam'd by an earthquake, half-brother
to the cholera, nearly related to the small-pox on the
mother's side! Look at me! I take nineteen alligators and a
bar'l of whisky for breakfast when I'm in robust health, and a
bushel of rattlesnakes and a dead body when I'm ailing! I
split the everlasting rocks with my glance, and I squench the
thunder when I speak! Whoo-oop! Stand back and give me
room according to my strength! Blood's my natural drink, and
the wails of the dying is music to my ear! Cast your eye on
me, gentlemen!&mdash;and lay low and hold your breath, for I'm
'bout to turn myself loose!"</p>

<p>All the time he was getting this off, he was shaking his head
and looking fierce and kind of swelling around in a little circle,
tucking up his wrist-bands and now and then straightening up
and beating his breast with his fist, saying "Look at me, gentlemen!"
When he got through he jumped up and cracked his
heels together three times, and let off a roaring "Whoo-oop!
I'm the bloodiest son of a wildcat that lives!"</p>

<p>Then the man that had started the row tilted his old slouch
hat down over his right eye; then he bent stooping forward,
with his back sagged and his south end sticking out far, and his
fists a-shoving out and drawing in in front of him, and so went
around in a little circle about three times, swelling himself up
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3792]</span>and breathing hard. Then he straightened, and jumped up and
cracked his heels together three times before he lit again (that
made them cheer), and he begun to shout like this:&mdash;"Whoo-oop!
bow your neck and spread, for the kingdom of
sorrow's a-coming! Hold me down to the earth, for I feel my
powers a-working! whoo-oop! I'm a child of sin; <i>don't</i> let me
get a start! Smoked glass, here, for all! Don't attempt to look
at me with the naked eye, gentlemen! When I'm playful I use
the meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude for a seine,
and drag the Atlantic Ocean for whales! I scratch my head
with the lightning and purr myself to sleep with the thunder!
When I'm cold I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe in it; when
I'm hot I fan myself with an equinoctial storm; when I'm thirsty
I reach up and suck a cloud dry like a sponge; when I range
the earth hungry, famine follows in my tracks! Whoo-oop! Bow
your neck and spread! I put my hand on the sun's face and
make it night in the earth; I bite a piece out of the moon and
hurry the seasons; I shake myself and crumble the mountains!
Contemplate me through leather&mdash;<i>don't</i> use the naked eye! I'm
the man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels! The massacre
of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments,
the destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life!
The boundless vastness of the great American desert is my
inclosed property, and I bury my dead on my own premises!"
He jumped up and cracked his heels together three times before
he lit (they cheered him again), and as he came down he shouted
out: "Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the pet child of
calamity's a-coming!"</p>

<p>Then the other one went to swelling around and blowing
again&mdash;the first one&mdash;the one they called Bob; next, the Child
of Calamity chipped in again, bigger than ever; then they both
got at it at the same time, swelling round and round each other
and punching their fists 'most into each other's faces, and whooping
and jawing like Injuns; then Bob called the Child names,
and the Child called him names back again: next, Bob called
him a heap rougher names, and the Child come back at him with
the very worst kind of language; next, Bob knocked the Child's
hat off, and the Child picked it up and kicked Bob's ribbony hat
about six foot; Bob went and got it and said never mind, this
warn't going to be the last of this thing, because he was a man
that never forgot and never forgive, and so the Child better look
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3793]</span>out; for there was a time a-coming, just as sure as he was a
living man, that he would have to answer to him with the best
blood in his body. The Child said no man was willinger than
he was for that time to come, and he would give Bob fair warning,
<i>now</i>, never to cross his path again, for he could never rest
till he had waded in his blood; for such was his nature, though
he was sparing him now on account of his family, if he had one.</p>

<p>Both of them was edging away in different directions, growling
and shaking their heads and going on about what they was
going to do; but a little black-whiskered chap skipped up and
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come back here, you couple of chicken-livered cowards, and
I'll thrash the two of ye!"</p>

<p>And he done it, too. He snatched them, he jerked them this
way and that, he booted them around, he knocked them sprawling
faster than they could get up. Why, it warn't two minutes
till they begged like dogs&mdash;and how the other lot did yell and
laugh and clap their hands all the way through, and shout "Sail
in, Corpse-Maker!" "Hi! at him again, Child of Calamity!"
"Bully for you, little Davy!" Well, it was a perfect pow-wow
for a while. Bob and the Child had red noses and black eyes
when they got through. Little Davy made them own up that
they was sneaks and cowards, and not fit to eat with a dog or
drink with a nigger; then Bob and the Child shook hands with
each other very solemn, and said they had always respected
each other and was willing to let bygones be bygones. So then
they washed their faces in the river; and just then there was a
loud order to stand by for a crossing, and some of them went
forward to man the sweeps there, and the rest went aft to handle
the after-sweeps.</p>

<h3><a name="A_STEAMBOAT_LANDING_AT_A_SMALL_TOWN" id="A_STEAMBOAT_LANDING_AT_A_SMALL_TOWN"></a>A STEAMBOAT LANDING AT A SMALL TOWN</h3>

<h4>From 'Life on the Mississippi': copyright 1883, by James R. Osgood and Company</h4>

<p>Once a day a cheap gaudy packet arrived upward from St.
Louis, and another downward from Keokuk. Before these
events, the day was glorious with expectancy; after them,
the day was a dead and empty thing. Not only the boys but
the whole village felt this. After all these years I can picture
that old time to myself now, just as it was then: the white town
drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's morning; the streets
empty, or pretty nearly so; one or two clerks sitting in front of
the Water Street stores, with their splint-bottomed chairs tilted
back against the wall, chins on breasts, hats slouched over their
faces, asleep&mdash;with shingle-shavings enough around to show
what broke them down; a sow and a litter of pigs loafing along
the sidewalk, doing a good business in watermelon rinds and
seeds; two or three lonely little freight piles scattered about the
"levee"; a pile of "skids" on the slope of the stone-paved
wharf, and the fragrant town drunkard asleep in the shadow of
them; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf, but nobody
to listen to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets against
them; the great Mississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi,
rolling its mile-wide tide along, shining in the sun; the
dense forest away on the other side; the "point" above the
town and the "point" below, bounding the river-glimpse and
turning it into a sort of sea, and withal a very still and brilliant
and lonely one. Presently a film of dark smoke appears above
one of those remote "points"; instantly a negro drayman, famous
for his quick eye and prodigious voice, lifts up the cry,
"S-t-e-a-m-boat a-comin'!" and the scene changes!  The town
drunkard stirs, the clerks wake up, a furious clatter of drays
follows, every house and store pours out a human contribution,
and all in a twinkling the dead town is alive and moving.
Drays, carts, men, boys, all go hurrying from many quarters to
a common centre, the wharf. Assembled there, the people fasten
their eyes upon the coming boat, as upon a wonder they are seeing
for the first time. And the boat <i>is</i> rather a handsome sight
too. She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two
tall fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3795]</span>
swung between them; a fanciful pilot-house, all glass and "gingerbread,"
perched on top of the "texas" deck behind them; the
paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays
above the boat's name; the boiler deck, the hurricane deck, and
the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings;
there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace
doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper
decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big
bell, calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest
smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys&mdash;a
husbanded grandeur created with a bit of pitch-pine just before
arriving at a town; the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the
broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied
deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of
rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the
gauge-cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels
stop; then they turn back, churning the water to a foam, and
the steamer is at rest. Then such a scramble as there is to get
aboard, and to get ashore, and to take in freight and to discharge
freight, all at one and the same time; and such a yelling
and cursing as the mates facilitate it all with! Ten minutes
later the steamer is under way again, with no flag on the jack-staff
and no black smoke issuing from the chimneys. After ten
more minutes the town is dead again, and the town drunkard
asleep by the skids once more.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HIGH_RIVER" id="THE_HIGH_RIVER"></a>THE HIGH RIVER: AND A PHANTOM PILOT</h3>

<h4>From 'Life on the Mississippi': copyright 1883, by James R. Osgood and
Company</h4>

<p>During this big rise these small-fry craft were an intolerable
nuisance.  We were running chute after chute,&mdash;a new
world to me,&mdash;and if there was a particularly cramped
place in a chute, we would be pretty sure to meet a broad-horn
there; and if he failed to be there, we would find him in a still
worse locality, namely, the head of the chute, on the shoal
water. And then there would be no end of profane cordialities
exchanged.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the big river, when we would be feeling our
way cautiously along through a fog, the deep hush would sud<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3796]</span>denly
be broken by yells and a clamor of tin pans, and all in an
instant a log raft would appear vaguely through the webby veil,
close upon us; and then we did not wait to swap knives, but
snatched our engine bells out by the roots and piled on all the
steam we had, to scramble out of the way! One doesn't hit a
rock or a solid log raft with a steamboat when he can get excused.</p>

<p>You will hardly believe it, but many steamboat clerks always
carried a large assortment of religious tracts with them in those
old departed steamboating days. Indeed they did. Twenty times
a day we would be cramping up around a bar, while a string of
these small-fry rascals were drifting down into the head of the
bend away above and beyond us a couple of miles. Now a skiff
would dart away from one of them, and come fighting its laborious
way across the desert of water. It would "ease all," in the
shadow of our forecastle, and the panting oarsmen would shout,
"Gimme a pa-a-per!" as the skiff drifted swiftly astern. The
clerk would throw over a file of New Orleans journals. If these
were picked up <i>without comment</i>, you might notice that now a
dozen other skiffs had been drifting down upon us without saying
anything. You understand, they had been waiting to see
how No. 1 was going to fare. No. 1 making no comment, all
the rest would bend to their oars and come on now; and as fast
as they came the clerk would heave over neat bundles of religious
tracts, tied to shingles. The amount of hard swearing which
twelve packages of religious literature will command when impartially
divided up among twelve raftsmen's crews, who have
pulled a heavy skiff two miles on a hot day to get them, is
simply incredible.</p>

<p>As I have said, the big rise brought a new world under my
vision. By the time the river was over its banks we had forsaken
our old paths and were hourly climbing over bars that
had stood ten feet out of water before; we were shaving stumpy
shores, like that at the foot of Madrid Bend, which I had always
seen avoided before; we were clattering through chutes like that
of 82, where the opening at the foot was an unbroken wall of
timber till our nose was almost at the very spot. Some of these
chutes were utter solitudes. The dense untouched forest over-hung
both banks of the crooked little crack, and one could
believe that human creatures had never intruded there before.
The swinging grapevines, the grassy nooks and vistas, glimpsed<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3797]</span>
as we swept by, the flowering creepers waving their red blossoms
from the tops of dead trunks, and all the spendthrift richness
of the forest foliage, were wasted and thrown away there.
The chutes were lovely places to steer in; they were deep, except
at the head; the current was gentle; under the "points" the
water was absolutely dead, and the invisible banks so bluff that
where the tender willow thickets projected you could bury your
boat's broadside in them as you tore along, and then you seemed
fairly to fly.</p>

<p>Behind other islands we found wretched little farms and
wretcheder little log cabins; there were crazy rail fences sticking
a foot or two above the water, with one or two jeans-clad, chills-racked,
yellow-faced male miserables roosting on the top rail,
elbows on knees, jaws in hands, grinding tobacco and discharging
the result at floating chips through crevices left by lost
teeth; while the rest of the family and the few farm animals
were huddled together in an empty wood flat riding at her moorings
close at hand. In this flatboat the family would have to
cook and eat and sleep for a lesser or greater number of days
(or possibly weeks), until the river should fall two or three feet
and let them get back to their log cabin and their chills again&mdash;chills
being a merciful provision of an all-wise Providence to enable
them to take exercise without exertion. And this sort of
watery camping out was a thing which these people were rather
liable to be treated to a couple of times a year: by the December
rise out of the Ohio, and the June rise out of the Mississippi.
And yet these were kindly dispensations, for they at least
enabled the poor things to rise from the dead now and then,
and look upon life when a steamboat went by. They appreciated
the blessing too, for they spread their mouths and eyes wide
open and made the most of these occasions. Now what <i>could</i>
these banished creatures find to do to keep from dying of the
blues during the low-water season!</p>

<p>Once in one of these lovely island chutes we found our
course completely bridged by a great fallen tree. This will
serve to show how narrow some of the chutes were. The passengers
had an hour's recreation in a virgin wilderness while the
boat hands chopped the bridge away; for there was no such
thing as turning back, you comprehend.</p>

<p>From Cairo to Baton Rouge, when the river is over its
banks, you have no particular trouble in the night, for the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3798]</span>
thousand-mile wall of dense forest that guards the two banks all
the way is only gapped with a farm or wood-yard opening at
intervals, and so you can't "get out of the river" much easier
than you could get out of a fenced lane; but from Baton Rouge
to New Orleans it is a different matter. The river is more than
a mile wide, and very deep&mdash;as much as two hundred feet, in
places. Both banks, for a good deal over a hundred miles, are
shorn of their timber and bordered by continuous sugar plantations,
with only here and there a scattering sapling or row of
ornamental China-trees. The timber is shorn off clear to the
rear of the plantations, from two to four miles. When the first
frost threatens to come, the planters snatch off their crops in a
hurry. When they have finished grinding the cane, they form
the refuse of the stalks (which they call <i>bagasse</i>) into great piles
and set fire to them, though in other sugar countries the bagasse
is used for fuel in the furnaces of the sugar-mills. Now
the piles of damp bagasse burn slowly, and smoke like Satan's
own kitchen.</p>

<p>An embankment ten or fifteen feet high guards both banks
of the Mississippi all the way down that lower end of the river,
and this embankment is set back from the edge of the shore
from ten to perhaps a hundred feet, according to circumstances;
say thirty or forty feet as a general thing. Fill that whole
region with an impenetrable gloom of smoke from a hundred
miles of burning bagasse piles, when the river is over the banks,
and turn a steamboat loose along there at midnight and see how
she will feel. And see how you will feel too! You find yourself
away out in the midst of a vague dim sea that is shoreless,
that fades out and loses itself in the murky distances; for you
cannot discern the thin rib of embankment, and you are always
imagining you see a straggling tree when you don't. The plantations
themselves are transformed by the smoke and look like a
part of the sea. All through your watch you are tortured with
the exquisite misery of uncertainty. You hope you are keeping
in the river, but you do not know. All that you are sure about
is that you are likely to be within six feet of the bank <i>and</i> destruction,
when you think you are a good half-mile from shore.
And you are sure also that if you chance suddenly to fetch up
against the embankment and topple your chimneys overboard, you
will have the small comfort of knowing that it is about what
you were expecting to do. One of the great Vicksburg packets<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3799]</span>
darted out into a sugar plantation one night, at such a time, and
had to stay there a week. But there was no novelty about it: it
had often been done before.</p>

<p>I thought I had finished this chapter, but I wish to add a
curious thing while it is in my mind. It is only relevant in
that it is connected with piloting. There used to be an excellent
pilot on the river, a Mr. X., who was a somnambulist. It
was said that if his mind was troubled about a bad piece of
river, he was pretty sure to get up and walk in his sleep and
do strange things. He was once fellow pilot for a trip or two
with George Ealer, on a great New Orleans passenger packet.
During a considerable part of the first trip George was uneasy,
but got over it by-and-by, as X. seemed content to stay in his
bed when asleep. Late one night the boat was approaching
Helena, Arkansas; the water was low, and the crossing above
the town in a very blind and tangled condition. X. had seen
the crossing since Ealer had, and as the night was particularly
drizzly, sullen, and dark, Ealer was considering whether he had
not better have X. called to assist in running the place, when
the door opened and X. walked in. Now on very dark nights,
light is a deadly enemy to piloting; you are aware that if you
stand in a lighted room on such a night, you cannot see things
in the street to any purpose; but if you put out the lights and
stand in the gloom you can make out objects in the street pretty
well. So on very dark nights pilots do not smoke; they allow
no fire in the pilot-house stove if there is a crack which can
allow the least ray to escape; they order the furnaces to be
curtained with huge tarpaulins and the skylights to be closely
blinded. Then no light whatever issues from the boat. The
undefinable shape that now entered the pilot-house had Mr. X.'s
voice. This said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me take her, George; I've seen this place since you
have, and it is so crooked that I reckon I can run it myself
easier than I could tell you how to do it."</p>

<p>"It is kind of you, and I swear <i>I</i> am willing. I haven't got
another drop of perspiration left in me. I have been spinning
around and around the wheel like a squirrel. It is so dark I
can't tell which way she is swinging till she is coming around
like a whirligig."</p>

<p>So Ealer took a seat on the bench, panting and breathless.
The black phantom assumed the wheel without saying anything,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3800]</span>
steadied the waltzing steamer with a turn or two, and then stood
at ease, coaxing her a little to this side and then to that, as
gently and as sweetly as if the time had been noonday. When
Ealer observed this marvel of steering, he wished he had not
confessed! He stared and wondered, and finally said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I thought I knew how to steer a steamboat, but that
was another mistake of mine."</p>

<p>X. said nothing, but went serenely on with his work. He
rang for the leads; he rang to slow down the steam; he worked
the boat carefully and neatly into invisible marks, then stood at
the centre of the wheel and peered blandly out into the blackness,
fore and aft, to verify his position; as the leads shoaled
more and more, he stopped the engines entirely, and the dead
silence and suspense of "drifting" followed; when the shoalest
water was struck, he cracked on the steam, carried her handsomely
over, and then began to work her warily into the next
system of shoal marks; the same patient, heedful use of leads
and engines followed, the boat slipped through without touching
bottom, and entered upon the third and last intricacy of the
crossing; imperceptibly she moved through the gloom, crept by
inches into her marks, drifted tediously till the shoalest water
was cried, and then, under a tremendous head of steam, went
swinging over the reef and away into deep water and safety!</p>

<p>Ealer let his long-pent breath pour out in a great relieving
sigh, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's the sweetest piece of piloting that was ever done on
the Mississippi River! I wouldn't believed it could be done, if I
hadn't seen it."</p>

<p>There was no reply, and he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just hold her five minutes longer, partner, and let me run
down and get a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>A minute later Ealer was biting into a pie, down in the
"texas," and comforting himself with coffee. Just then the
night watchman happened in, and was about to happen out
again, when he noticed Ealer and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is at the wheel, sir?"</p>

<p>"X."</p>

<p>"Dart for the pilot-house, quicker than lightning!"</p>

<p>The next moment both men were flying up the pilot-house
companion-way, three steps at a jump! Nobody there! The
great steamer was whistling down the middle of the river at<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3801]</span>
her own sweet will! The watchman shot out of the place again;
Ealer seized the wheel, set the engine back with power, and held
his breath while the boat reluctantly swung away from a "towhead"
which she was about to knock into the middle of the Gulf
of Mexico!</p>

<p>By-and-by the watchman came back and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Didn't that lunatic tell you he was asleep when he first
came up here?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, he was. I found him walking along on top of the
railings, just as unconcerned as another man would walk a
pavement; and I put him to bed; now just this minute there
he was again, away astern, going through that sort of tightrope
deviltry the same as before."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I'll stay by, next time he has one of those
fits. But I hope he'll have them often. You just ought to
have seen him take this boat through Helena crossing. <i>I</i> never
saw anything so gaudy before. And if he can do such gold-leaf,
kid-glove, diamond-breastpin piloting when he is sound
asleep, what <i>couldn't</i> he do if he was dead!"</p>

<h3><a name="RIVER_SCENE" id="RIVER_SCENE"></a>AN ENCHANTING RIVER SCENE</h3>

<h4>From 'Life on the Mississippi': copyright 1883, by James R. Osgood and
Company</h4>

<p>The face of the water in time became a wonderful book&mdash;a
book that was a dead language to the uneducated passenger,
but which told its mind to me without reserve,
delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered
them with a voice.  And it was not a book to be read once
and thrown aside, for it had a new story to tell every day.
Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there was never a
page that was void of interest, never one that you could
leave unread without loss, never one that you would want to
skip, thinking you could find higher enjoyment in some other
thing. There never was so wonderful a book written by man;
never one whose interest was so absorbing, so unflagging, so
sparklingly renewed with every re-perusal.  The passenger who
could not read it was charmed with a peculiar sort of faint dimple
on its surface (on the rare occasions when he did not over<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3802]</span>look
it altogether); but to the pilot that was an <i>italicized</i> passage;
indeed it was more than that,&mdash;it was a legend of the largest
capitals, with a string of shouting exclamation-points at the end
of it; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there, that
could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated.
It is the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes,
and the most hideous to a pilot's eye. In truth, the passenger
who could not read this book saw nothing but all manner of
pretty pictures in it, painted by the sun and shaded by the
clouds; whereas to the trained eye these were not pictures at all,
but the grimmest and most dead-earnest of reading matter.</p>

<p>Now when I had mastered the language of this water and
had come to know every trifling feature that bordered the great
river as familiarly as I knew the letters of the alphabet, I had
made a valuable acquisition. But I had lost something too. I
had lost something which could never be restored to me while I
lived. All the grace, the beauty, the poetry had gone out of the
majestic river! I still kept in mind a certain wonderful sunset
which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me. A broad
expanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle distance
the red hue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log
came floating, black and conspicuous; in one place a long slanting
mark lay sparkling upon the water; in another the surface
was broken by boiling tumbling rings that were as many-tinted
as an opal; where the ruddy flush was faintest, was a smooth
spot that was covered with graceful circles and radiating lines,
ever so delicately traced; the shore on our left was densely
wooded, and the sombre shadow that fell from this forest was
broken in one place by a long ruffled trail that shone like silver;
and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree
waved a single leafy bough, that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed
splendor that was flowing from the sun. There were
graceful curves, reflected images, woody heights, soft distances;
and over the whole scene, far and near, the dissolving lights
drifted steadily, enriching it every passing moment with new
marvels of coloring.</p>

<p>I stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a speechless
rapture. The world was new to me, and I had never seen anything
like this at home. But as I have said, a day came when
I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which
the moon and the sun and the twilight wrought upon the river's<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3803]</span>
face; another day came when I ceased altogether to note them.
Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should have
looked upon it without rapture and should have commented
upon it inwardly after this fashion: This sun means that we
are going to have wind to-morrow; that floating log means that
the river is rising, small thanks to it; that slanting mark on the
water refers to a bluff reef which is going to kill somebody's
steamboat one of these nights, if it keeps on stretching out like
that; those tumbling "boils" show a dissolving bar and a changing
channel there; the lines and circles in the slick water over
yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is shoaling up
dangerously; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is the
"break" from a new snag, and he has located himself in the
very best place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that
tall dead tree, with a single living branch, is not going to last
long, and then how is a body ever going to get through this
blind place at night without the friendly old landmark?</p>

<p>No, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the
river. All the value any feature of it had for me now was the
amount of usefulness it could furnish toward compassing the
safe piloting of a steamboat. Since those days I have pitied
doctors from my heart. What does the lovely flush in a beauty's
cheek mean to a doctor but a "break" that ripples above some
deadly disease? Are not all her visible charms sown thick with
what are to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay? Does
he ever see her beauty at all, or doesn't he simply view her professionally
and comment upon her unwholesome condition all to
himself? And doesn't he sometimes wonder whether he has
gained most or lost most by learning his trade?</p>

<h3><a name="THE_LIGHTNING_PILOT" id="THE_LIGHTNING_PILOT"></a>THE LIGHTNING PILOT</h3>

<h4>From 'Life on the Mississippi': copyright 1883, by James R. Osgood and Company</h4>

<p>Next morning I felt pretty rusty and low-spirited. We went
booming along, taking a good many chances, for we were
anxious to "get out of the river" (as getting out to Cairo
was called) before night should overtake us. But Mr. Bixby's
partner, the other pilot, presently grounded the boat, and we
lost so much time getting her off that it was plain the darkness<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3804]</span>
would overtake us a good long way above the mouth. This was
a great misfortune; especially to certain of our visiting pilots,
whose boats would have to wait for their return, no matter how
long that might be. It sobered the pilot-house talk a good deal.
Coming up-stream, pilots did not mind low water or any kind of
darkness; nothing stopped them but fog. But down-stream work
was different; a boat was too nearly helpless, with a stiff current
pushing behind her; so it was not customary to run down-stream
at night in low water.</p>

<p>There seemed to be one small hope, however: if we could get
through the intricate and dangerous Hat Island crossing before
night, we could venture the rest, for we would have plainer sailing
and better water. But it would be insanity to attempt Hat
Island at night. So there was a deal of looking at watches all
the rest of the day, and a constant ciphering upon the speed we
were making; Hat Island was the eternal subject; sometimes
hope was high, and sometimes we were delayed in a bad crossing,
and down it went again. For hours all hands lay under
the burden of this suppressed excitement; it was even communicated
to me, and I got to feeling so solicitous about Hat Island,
and under such an awful pressure of responsibility, that I wished
I might have five minutes on shore to draw a good full relieving
breath, and start over again. We were standing no regular
watches. Each of our pilots ran such portions of the river as
he had run when coming up-stream, because of his greater familiarity
with it; but both remained in the pilot-house constantly.</p>

<p>An hour before sunset, Mr. Bixby took the wheel and Mr.
W&mdash;&mdash; stepped aside.  For the next thirty minutes every man
held his watch in his hand and was restless, silent, and uneasy.
At last somebody said with a doomful sigh:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, yonder's Hat Island&mdash;and we can't make it."</p>

<p>All the watches closed with a snap, everybody sighed and
muttered something about its being "too bad, too bad&mdash;ah, if
we could <i>only</i> have got here half an hour sooner!" and the place
was thick with the atmosphere of disappointment. Some started
to go out, but loitered, hearing no bell-tap to land. The sun
dipped behind the horizon, the boat went on. Inquiring looks
passed from one guest to another; and one who had his hand on
the door-knob and had turned it, waited, then presently took
away his hand and let the knob turn back again. We bore
steadily down the bend. More looks were exchanged, and nods<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3805]</span>
of surprised admiration&mdash;but no words. Insensibly the men
drew together behind Mr. Bixby, as the sky darkened and one or
two dim stars came out. The dead silence and sense of waiting
became oppressive. Mr. Bixby pulled the cord, and two deep
mellow notes from the big bell floated off on the night. Then a
pause, and one more note was struck. The watchman's voice
followed, from the hurricane deck:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Labboard lead, there! Stabboard lead!"</p>

<p>The cries of the leadsmen began to rise out of the distance,
and were gruffly repeated by the word-passers on the hurricane
deck.</p>

<p>"M-a-r-k three!... M-a-r-k three!... Quarter-less-three!...
Half twain!... Quarter twain!...
M-a-r-k twain!... Quarter-less&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Bixby pulled two bell-ropes, and was answered by faint
jinglings far below in the engine-room, and our speed slackened.
The steam began to whistle through the gauge-cocks. The cries
of the leadsmen went on&mdash;and it is a weird sound always in
the night. Every pilot in the lot was watching now, with fixed
eyes, and talking under his breath. Nobody was calm and easy
but Mr. Bixby. He would put his wheel down and stand on a
spoke, and as the steamer swung into her (to me) utterly invisible
marks&mdash;for we seemed to be in the midst of a wide and
gloomy sea&mdash;he would meet and fasten her there. Out of the
murmur of half-audible talk one caught a coherent sentence now
and then, such as:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There; she's over the first reef all right!"</p>

<p>After a pause, another subdued voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Her stern's coming down just <i>exactly</i> right, by <i>George</i>!"</p>

<p>"Now she's in the marks; over she goes!"</p>

<p>Somebody else muttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, it was done beautiful&mdash;<i>beautiful</i>!"</p>

<p>Now the engines were stopped altogether, and we drifted
with the current. Not that I could see the boat drift, for I
could not, the stars being all gone by this time. This drifting
was the dismalest work; it held one's heart still. Presently I
discovered a blacker gloom than that which surrounded us. It
was the head of the island. We were closing right down upon
it. We entered its deeper shadow, and so imminent seemed the
peril that I was likely to suffocate; and I had the strongest impulse
to do <i>something</i>, anything, to save the vessel. But still<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3806]</span>
Mr. Bixby stood by his wheel, silent, intent as a cat, and all the
pilots stood shoulder to shoulder at his back.</p>

<p>"She'll not make it!" somebody whispered.</p>

<p>The water grew shoaler and shoaler, by the leadsman's cries,
till it was down to&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eight-and-a-half!... E-i-g-h-t feet!... E-i-g-h-t
feet!... Seven-and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Bixby said warningly through his speaking-tube to the
engineer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stand by, now!"</p>

<p>"Ay-ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Seven-and-a-half! Seven feet! <i>Six</i>-and&mdash;"</p>

<p>We touched bottom! Instantly Mr. Bixby set a lot of bells
ringing, shouted through the tube, "<i>Now</i> let her have it&mdash;every
ounce you've got!" then to his partner, "Put her hard down!
snatch her! snatch her!" The boat rasped and ground her way
through the sand, hung upon the apex of disaster a single tremendous
instant, and then over she went! And such a shout as
went up at Mr. Bixby's back never loosened the roof of a pilot-house
before!</p>

<p>There was no more trouble after that. Mr. Bixby was a hero
that night; and it was some little time, too, before his exploit
ceased to be talked about by river men.</p>

<h3><a name="AGAINST_OGRES" id="AGAINST_OGRES"></a>AN EXPEDITION AGAINST OGRES</h3>

<h4>From 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court': copyright 1889, by
Charles L. Webster and Company</h4>

<p>My expedition was all the talk that day and that night, and
the boys were very good to me, and made much of me,
and seemed to have forgotten their vexation and disappointment,
and come to be as anxious for me to hive those
ogres and set those ripe old virgins loose as if it were themselves
that had the contract. Well, they <i>were</i> good children&mdash;but
just children, that is all. And they gave me no end of
points about how to scout for giants, and how to scoop them in;
and they told me all sorts of charms against enchantments, and
gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my wounds. But it
never occurred to one of them to reflect that if I was such a
wonderful necromancer as I was pretending to be, I ought not to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3807]</span>
need salves, or instructions, or charms against enchantments, and
least of all arms and armor, on a foray of any kind&mdash;even
against fire-spouting dragons and devils hot from perdition, let
alone such poor adversaries as these I was after, these commonplace
ogres of the back settlements.</p>

<p>I was to have an early breakfast, and start at dawn, for that
was the usual way; but I had the demon's own time with
my armor, and this delayed me a little. It is troublesome
to get into, and there is so much detail. First you wrap a layer
or two of blanket around your body for a sort of cushion, and
to keep off the cold iron; then you put on your sleeves and
shirt of chain-mail&mdash;these are made of small steel links woven
together, and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss
your shirt on to the floor it slumps into a pile like a peck of wet
fish-net; it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest
material in the world for a night shirt, yet plenty used it for
that&mdash;tax collectors and reformers, and one-horse kings with a
defective title, and those sorts of people; then you put on your
shoes&mdash;flatboats roofed over with interleaving bands of steel&mdash;and
screw your clumsy spurs into the heels. Next you buckle
your greaves on your legs and your cuisses on your thighs; then
come your backplate and your breastplate, and you begin to
feel crowded; then you hitch on to the breastplate the half-petticoat
of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down
in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down, and
isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal-scuttle, either for
looks, or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt on
your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints on to your arms,
your iron gauntlets on to your hands, your iron rat-trap on to
your head, with a rag of steel web hitched on to it to hang over
the back of your neck&mdash;and there you are, snug as a candle in
a candle-mold. This is no time to dance. Well, a man that is
packed away like that is a nut that isn't worth the cracking,
there is so little of the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison
with the shell.</p>

<p>The boys helped me, or I never could have got in. Just as
we finished, Sir Bedivere happened in, and I saw that as like as
not I hadn't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip.
How stately he looked; and tall and broad and grand. He had
on his head a conical steel casque that only came down to his
ears, and for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3808]</span>
down to his upper lip and protected his nose; and all the rest of
him, from neck to heel, was flexible chain-mail, trousers and all.
But pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment,
which of course was of chain-mail, as I said, and hung
straight from his shoulders to his ankles; and from his middle to
the bottom, both before and behind, was divided, so that he
could ride and let the skirts hang down on each side. He was
going grailing, and it was just the outfit for it, too. I would
have given a good deal for that ulster, but it was too late now
to be fooling around. The sun was just up; the king and the
court were all on hand to see me off and wish me luck; so it
wouldn't be etiquette for me to tarry. You don't get on your
horse yourself; no, if you tried it you would get disappointed.
They carry you out, just as they carry a sun-struck man to the
drug-store, and put you on, and help get you to rights, and fix
your feet in the stirrups; and all the while you do feel so
strange and stuffy and like somebody else&mdash;like somebody that
has been married on a sudden, or struck by lightning, or something
like that, and hasn't quite fetched around yet, and is sort
of numb, and can't just get his bearings. Then they stood up
the mast they called a spear in its socket by my left foot, and I
gripped it with my hand; lastly they hung my shield around my
neck, and I was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to
sea. Everybody was as good to me as they could be, and a
maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self. There was
nothing more to do now but for that damsel to get up behind
me on a pillion, which she did, and put an arm or so around
me to hold on.</p>

<p>And so we started; and everybody gave us a good-by and
waved their handkerchiefs or helmets. And everybody we met,
going down the hill and through the village, was respectful to us
except some shabby little boys on the outskirts. They said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, what a guy!" and hove clods at us.</p>

<p>In my experience boys are the same in all ages. They
don't respect anything, they don't care for anything or anybody.
They say "Go up, bald-head!" to the prophet going his unoffending
way in the gray of antiquity; they sass me in the holy
gloom of the Middle Ages; and I had seen them act the same
way in Buchanan's administration; I remember, because I was
there and helped. The prophet had his bears and settled with
his boys; and I wanted to get down and settle with mine, but it<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3809]</span>
wouldn't answer, because I couldn't have got up again. I hate
a country without a derrick.</p>

<p>Straight off, we were in the country. It was most lovely
and pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning
in the first freshness of autumn. From hilltops we saw fair
green valleys lying spread out below, with streams winding
through them, and island groves of trees here and there, and
huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting black blots of
shade; and beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills, blue
with haze, stretching away in billowy perspective to the horizon,
with at wide intervals a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave-summit,
which we knew was a castle. We crossed broad natural
lawns sparkling with dew, and we moved like spirits, the cushioned
turf giving out no sound of footfall; we dreamed along
through glades in a mist of green light that got its tint from
the sun-drenched roof of leaves overhead, and by our feet the
clearest and coldest of runlets went frisking and gossiping over
its reefs and making a sort of whispering music comfortable to
hear; and at times we left the world behind and entered into
the solemn great deeps and rich gloom of the forest, where furtive
wild things whisked and scurried by and were gone before
you could even get your eye on the place where the noise was;
and where only the earliest birds were turning out and getting
to business, with a song here and a quarrel yonder and a mysterious
far-off hammering and drumming for worms on a tree-trunk
away somewhere in the impenetrable remoteness of the
woods. And by-and-by out we would swing again into the
glare.</p>

<p>About the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out
into the glare&mdash;it was along there somewhere, a couple of hours
or so after sun-up&mdash;it wasn't as pleasant as it had been. It was
beginning to get hot. This was quite noticeable. We had a
very long pull, after that, without any shade. Now it is curious
how progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once
get a start. Things which I didn't mind at all at first, I began
to mind now&mdash;and more and more, too, all the time. The first
ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief I didn't seem to
care; I got along, and said never mind, it isn't any matter, and
dropped it out of my mind. But now it was different: I wanted
it all the time; it was nag, nag, nag, right along, and no rest;
I couldn't get it out of my mind; and so at last I lost my<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3810]</span>
temper, and said hang a man that would make a suit of armor
without any pockets in it. You see I had my handkerchief in
my helmet, and some other things; but it was that kind of a
helmet that you can't take off by yourself. That hadn't occurred
to me when I put it there; and in fact I didn't know it. I
supposed it would be particularly convenient there. And so
now the thought of its being there, so handy and close by, and
yet not get-at-able, made it all the worse and the harder to
bear. Yes, the thing that you can't get is the thing that you
want, mainly; every one has noticed that. Well, it took my mind
off from everything else; took it clear off and centred it in my
helmet; and mile after mile there it stayed, imagining the handkerchief,
picturing the handkerchief; and it was bitter and aggravating
to have the salt sweat keep trickling down into my eyes,
and I couldn't get at it. It seems like a little thing on paper,
but it was not a little thing at all; it was the most real kind of
misery. I would not say it if it was not so. I made up my
mind that I would carry along a reticule next time, let it look
how it might and people say what they would. Of course these
iron dudes of the Round Table would think it was scandalous,
and maybe raise sheol about it, but as for me, give me comfort
first and style afterwards. So we jogged along, and now and
then we struck a stretch of dust, and it would tumble up in
clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and
of course I said things I oughtn't to have said,&mdash;I don't deny
that. I am not better than others. We couldn't seem to meet
anybody in this lonesome Britain, not even an ogre; and in the
mood I was in then, it was well for the ogre; that is, an ogre
with a handkerchief. Most knights would have thought of nothing
but getting his armor; but so I got his bandana, he could
keep his hardware for all me.</p>

<p>Meantime it was getting hotter and hotter in there. You
see the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more
and more all the time. Well, when you are hot, that way, every
little thing irritates you. When I trotted I rattled like a crate
of dishes, and that annoyed me; and moreover I couldn't seem
to stand that shield slatting and banging, now about my breast,
now around my back; and if I dropped into a walk my joints
creaked and screeched in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow
does, and as we didn't create any breeze at that gait, I was
like to get fried in that stove; and besides, the quieter you went<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3811]</span>
the heavier the iron settled down on you, and the more and more
tons you seemed to weigh every minute. And you had to be
always changing hands and passing your spear over to the
other foot, it got so irksome for one hand to hold it long at a
time.</p>

<p>Well, you know when you perspire that way, in rivers,
there comes a time when you&mdash;when you&mdash;well, when you itch.
You are inside, your hands are outside: so there you are; nothing
but iron between. It is not a light thing, let it sound as it
may. First it is one place; then another; then some more; and
it goes on spreading and spreading, and at last the territory is
all occupied, and nobody can imagine what you feel like, nor
how unpleasant it is. And when it had got to the worst, and it
seemed to me that I could not stand anything more, a fly got in
through the bars and settled on my nose, and the bars were
stuck and wouldn't work, and I couldn't get the visor up; and I
could only shake my head, which was baking hot by this time,
and the fly&mdash;well, you know how a fly acts when he has got a
certainty: he only minded the shaking enough to change from
nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzz all around in
there, and keep on lighting and biting in a way that a person
already so distressed as I was simply could not stand. So I
gave in, and got Alisande to unship the helmet and relieve me
of it. Then she emptied the conveniences out of it and fetched
it full of water, and I drank and then stood up and she poured
the rest down inside the armor. One cannot think how refreshing
it was. She continued to fetch and pour until I was well
soaked and thoroughly comfortable.</p>

<p>It was good to have a rest&mdash;and peace. But nothing is
quite perfect in this life at any time. I had made a pipe a while
back, and also some pretty fair tobacco; not the real thing, but
what some of the Indians use: the inside bark of the willow,
dried. These comforts had been in the helmet, and now I had
them again, but no matches.</p>

<p>Gradually, as the time wore along, one annoying fact was
borne in upon my understanding&mdash;that we were weather-bound.
An armed novice cannot mount his horse without help and
plenty of it. Sandy was not enough; not enough for me, anyway.
We had to wait until somebody should come along.
Waiting in silence would have been agreeable enough, for I was
full of matter for reflection, and wanted to give it a chance to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3812]</span>
work. I wanted to try and think out how it was that rational or
even half-rational men could ever have learned to wear armor,
considering its inconveniences; and how they had managed to
keep up such a fashion for generations when it was plain that
what I had suffered to-day they had had to suffer all the days
of their lives. I wanted to think that out; and moreover I
wanted to think out some way to reform this evil and persuade
the people to let the foolish fashion die out: but thinking was
out of the question in the circumstances. You couldn't think
where Sandy was. She was a quite biddable creature and good-hearted,
but she had a flow of talk that was as steady as a
mill and made your head sore like the drays and wagons in a
city. If she had had a cork she would have been a comfort.
But you can't cork that kind; they would die. Her clack was
going all day, and you would think something would surely
happen to her works by-and-by; but no, they never got out of
order; and she never had to slack up for words. She could
grind and pump and churn and buzz by the week, and never
stop to oil up or blow out. And yet the result was just nothing
but wind. She never had any ideas, any more than a fog has.
She was a perfect blatherskite; I mean for jaw, jaw, jaw, talk,
talk, talk, jabber, jabber, jabber;&mdash;but just as good as she could
be. I hadn't minded her mill that morning, on account of having
that hornet's nest of other troubles; but more than once in
the afternoon I had to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take a rest, child; the way you are using up all the
domestic air, the kingdom will have to go to importing it by
to-morrow, and it's a low enough treasury without that."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_TRUE_PRINCE_AND_THE_FEIGNED_ONE" id="THE_TRUE_PRINCE_AND_THE_FEIGNED_ONE"></a>THE TRUE PRINCE AND THE FEIGNED ONE</h3>

<h4>From 'The Prince and the Pauper': copyright 1889, by Charles L. Webster
and Company</h4>

<p>At last the final act was at hand. The Archbishop of Canterbury
lifted up the crown of England from its cushion and
held it out over the trembling mock king's head. In the
same instant a rainbow radiance flashed along the spacious transept;
for with one impulse every individual in the great concourse
of nobles lifted a coronet and poised it over his or her
head&mdash;and paused in that attitude.</p>

<p>A deep hush pervaded the Abbey. At this impressive
moment a startling apparition intruded upon the scene&mdash;an apparition
observed by none in the absorbed multitude, until it
suddenly appeared, moving up the great central isle. It was a
boy, bare-headed, ill shod, and clothed in coarse plebeian garments
that were falling to rags. He raised his hand with a
solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect,
and delivered this note of warning:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited
head. <i>I</i> am the king!"</p>

<p>In an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy,
but in the same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made
a swift step forward and cried out in a ringing voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Loose him and forbear! He <i>is</i> the king!"</p>

<p>A sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and
they partly rose in their places and stared in a bewildered way
at one another and at the chief figures in this scene, like persons
who wondered whether they were awake and in their senses or
asleep and dreaming. The Lord Protector was as amazed as the
rest, but quickly recovered himself and exclaimed in a voice of
authority:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again&mdash;seize
the vagabond!"</p>

<p>He would have been obeyed, but the mock king stamped his
foot and cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On your peril! Touch him not, he is the king!"</p>

<p>The hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no
one moved, no one spoke; indeed no one knew how to act or
what to say, in so strange and surprising an emergency. While
all minds were struggling to right themselves, the boy still<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3814]</span>
moved steadily forward, with high port and confident mien; he
had never halted from the beginning; and while the tangled
minds still floundered helplessly, he stepped upon the platform,
and the mock king ran with a glad face to meet him, and fell on
his knees before him and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O my lord the king, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear
fealty to thee, and say, 'Put on thy crown and enter into thine
own again!'"</p>

<p>The Lord Protector's eye fell sternly upon the new-comer's
face; but straightway the sternness vanished away, and gave
place to an expression of wondering surprise. This thing happened
also to the other great officers. They glanced at each
other, and retreated a step by a common and unconscious impulse.
The thought in each mind was the same: "What a
strange resemblance!"</p>

<p>The Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity;
then he said, with grave respectfulness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By your favor, sir, I desire to ask certain questions
which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will answer them, my lord."</p>

<p>The duke asked him many questions about the court, the late
king, the prince, the princesses,&mdash;the boy answered them correctly
and without hesitating. He described the rooms of state
in the palace, the late king's apartments, and those of the
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>It was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable&mdash;so
all said that heard it. The tide was beginning to turn, and
Tom Canty's hopes to run high, when the Lord Protector shook
his head and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is true it is most wonderful&mdash;but it is no more than our
lord the king likewise can do." This remark, and this reference
to himself as still the king, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his
hopes crumbling under him. "These are not <i>proofs</i>," added the
Protector.</p>

<p>The tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed&mdash;but
in the wrong direction; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded
on the throne, and sweeping the other out to sea. The Lord
Protector communed with himself&mdash;shook his head; the thought
forced itself upon him, "It is perilous to the State and to us all,
to entertain so fateful a riddle as this; it could divide the nation
and undermine the throne." He turned and said:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3815]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas, arrest this&mdash;No, hold!" His face lighted,
and he confronted the ragged candidate with this question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where lieth the Great Seal? Answer me this truly, and
the riddle is unriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales
<i>can</i> so answer! On so trivial a thing hang a throne and a
dynasty!"</p>

<p>It was a lucky thought, a happy thought. That it was so
considered by the great officials was manifested by the silent
applause that shot from eye to eye around their circle in the
form of bright approving glances. Yes, none but the true prince
could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the vanished Great Seal&mdash;this
forlorn little impostor had been taught his lesson well,
but here his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself could
not answer <i>that</i> question&mdash;ah, very good, very good indeed;
now we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in
short order! And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly
with satisfaction, and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with
a palsy of guilty confusion. How surprised they were, then, to
see nothing of the sort happen&mdash;how they marveled to hear
him answer up promptly in a confident and untroubled voice
and say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is naught in this riddle that is difficult." Then,
without so much as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and
gave this command with the easy manner of one accustomed to
doing such things: "My lord St. John, go you to my private
cabinet in the palace,&mdash;for none knoweth the place better than
you,&mdash;and close down to the floor, in the left corner, remotest
from the door that opens from the ante-chamber, you shall find
in the wall a brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little jewel-closet
will fly open, which not even you do know of&mdash;no, nor
any soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan
that did contrive it for me. The first thing that falleth under
your eye will be the Great Seal&mdash;fetch it hither."</p>

<p>All the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still
more to see the little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy
or apparent fear of mistake, and call him by name with
such a placidly convincing air of having known him all his life.
The peer was almost surprised into obeying. He even made a
movement as if to go, but quickly recovered his tranquil attitude
and confessed his blunder with a blush. Tom Canty turned upon
him and said sharply:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3816]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why dost thou hesitate? Hast not heard the king's command?
Go!"</p>

<p>The lord St. John made a deep obeisance&mdash;and it was observed
that it was a significantly cautious and non-committal one,
it not being delivered at either of the kings, but at the neutral
ground about half-way between the two&mdash;and took his leave.</p>

<p>Now began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official
group which was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady
and persistent,&mdash;a movement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope
that is turned slowly, whereby the components of one
splendid cluster fall away and join themselves to another&mdash;a
movement which little by little, in the present case, dissolved the
glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty and clustered it together
again in the neighborhood of the new-comer. Tom Canty
stood almost alone. Now ensued a brief season of deep suspense
and waiting&mdash;during which even the few faint-hearts still remaining
near Tom Canty gradually scraped together courage
enough to glide, one by one, over to the majority. So at last
Tom Canty, in his royal robes and jewels, stood wholly alone
and isolated from the world, a conspicuous figure, occupying an
elegant vacancy.</p>

<p>Now the lord St. John was seen returning. As he advanced
up the mid-aisle, the interest was so intense that the low murmur
of conversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded
by a profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which
his footfalls pulsed with a dull and distant sound. Every eye
was fastened upon him as he moved along. He reached the
platform, paused a moment, then moved toward Tom Canty with
a deep obeisance, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, the Seal is not there!"</p>

<p>A mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient
with more haste than the band of pallid and terrified
courtiers melted away from the presence of the shabby little
claimant of the crown. In a moment he stood all alone, without
friend or supporter, a target upon which was concentrated a
bitter fire of scornful and angry looks. The Lord Protector
called out fiercely:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through
the town&mdash;the paltry knave is worth no more consideration!"</p>

<p>Officers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty
waved them off and said:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3817]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Back! Whoso touches him perils his life!"</p>

<p>The Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree. He
said to the lord St. John:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Searched you well?&mdash;but it boots not to ask that. It doth
seem passing strange. Little things, trifles, slip out of one's
ken, and one does not think it matter for surprise; but how so
bulky a thing as the Seal of England can vanish away and no
man be able to get track of it again&mdash;a massy golden disk&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted:</p>

<p>"Hold, that is enough! Was it round?&mdash;and thick?&mdash;and
had it letters and devices graved upon it?&mdash;Yes? Oh, <i>now</i> I
know what this Great Seal is, that there's been such worry and
pother about! An ye had described it to me, ye could have had
it three weeks ago. Right well I know where it lies; but it was
not I that put it there&mdash;first."</p>

<p>"Who then, my liege?" asked the Lord Protector.</p>

<p>"He that stands there&mdash;the rightful king of England. And
he shall tell you himself where it lies&mdash;then you will believe he
knew it of his own knowledge. Bethink thee, my king&mdash;spur
thy memory&mdash;it was the last, the very <i>last</i> thing thou didst that
day before thou didst rush forth from the palace, clothed in my
rags, to punish the soldier that insulted me."</p>

<p>A silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper,
and all eyes were fixed upon the new-comer, who stood with
bent head and corrugated brow, groping in his memory among a
thronging multitude of valueless recollections for one single little
elusive fact, which, found, would seat him upon a throne&mdash;unfound,
would leave him as he was for good and all&mdash;a pauper
and an outcast. Moment after moment passed&mdash;the moments
built themselves into minutes&mdash;still the boy struggled silently
on, and gave no sign. But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his
head slowly, and said, with a trembling lip and in a despondent
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I call the scene back&mdash;all of it&mdash;but the Seal hath no place
in it." He paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity,
"My lords and gentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign
of his own for lack of this evidence which he is not able
to furnish, I may not stay ye, being powerless. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh folly, oh madness, my king!" cried Tom Canty in a
panic; "wait!&mdash;think! Do not give up!&mdash;the cause is not lost!
nor <i>shall</i> be, neither! List to what I say&mdash;follow every word<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3818]</span>&mdash;I
am going to bring that morning back again, every hap just as
it happened. We talked&mdash;I told you of my sisters, Nan and
Bet&mdash;ah yes, you remember that; and about my old grandam&mdash;and
the rough games of the lads of Offal Court&mdash;yes, you remember
these things also; very well, follow me still, you shall
recall everything. You gave me food and drink, and did with
princely courtesy send away the servants, so that my low breeding
might not shame me before them&mdash;ah yes, this also you
remember."</p>

<p>As Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his
head in recognition of them, the great audience and the officials
stared in puzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history,
yet how could this impossible conjunction between a prince and
a beggar boy have come about? Never was a company of people
so perplexed, so interested, and so stupefied before.</p>

<p>"For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments. Then
we stood before a mirror; and so alike were we that both said it
seemed as if there had been no change made&mdash;yes, you remember
that. Then you noticed that the soldier had hurt my hand&mdash;look!
here it is, I cannot yet even write with it, the fingers
are so stiff.  At this your Highness sprang up, vowing vengeance
upon that soldier, and ran toward the door&mdash;you passed
a table&mdash;that thing you call the Seal lay on that table&mdash;you
snatched it up and looked eagerly about, as if for a place to
hide it&mdash;your eye caught sight of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, 'tis sufficient!&mdash;and the dear God be thanked!" exclaimed
the ragged claimant, in a mighty excitement. "Go, my
good St. John,&mdash;in an arm-piece of the Milanese armor that
hangs on the wall, thou'lt find the Seal!"</p>

<p>"Right, my king! right!" cried Tom Canty; "<i>now</i> the sceptre
of England is thine own; and it were better for him that would
dispute it that he had been born dumb! Go, my lord St. John,
give thy feet wings!"</p>

<p>The whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh
out of its mind with uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming
excitement. On the floor and on the platform a deafening buzz
of frantic conversation burst forth, and for some time nobody
knew anything or heard anything or was interested in anything
but what his neighbor was shouting into his ear, or he was
shouting into his neighbor's ear. Time&mdash;nobody knew how
much of it&mdash;swept by unheeded and unnoted.&mdash;At last a sudden<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3819]</span>
hush fell upon the house, and in the same moment St. John appeared
upon the platform and held the Great Seal aloft in his
hand. Then such a shout went up!</p>

<p>"Long live the true king!"</p>

<p>For five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of
musical instruments, and was white with a storm of waving
handkerchiefs; and through it all a ragged lad, the most conspicuous
figure in England, stood, flushed and happy and proud,
in the centre of the spacious platform, with the great vassals of
the kingdom kneeling around him.</p>

<p>Then all rose, and Tom Canty cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, O my king, take these regal garments back, and give
poor Tom thy servant his shreds and remnants again."</p>

<p>The Lord Protector spoke up:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower."</p>

<p>But the new king, the true king, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will not have it so. But for him I had not got my crown
again&mdash;none shall lay a hand upon him to harm him. And as
for thee, my good uncle, my Lord Protector, this conduct of
thine is not grateful toward this poor lad, for I hear he hath
made thee a duke"&mdash;the Protector blushed&mdash;"yet he was not a
king; wherefore, what is thy fine title worth now? To-morrow
you shall sue to me, <i>through him</i>, for its confirmation, else no
duke, but a simple earl, shalt thou remain."</p>

<p>Under this rebuke his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a
little from the front for the moment. The king turned to Tom,
and said kindly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My poor boy, how was it that you could remember where I
hid the Seal, when I could not remember it myself?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my king, that was easy, since I used it divers days."</p>

<p>"Used it,&mdash;yet could not explain where it was?"</p>

<p>"I did not know it was <i>that</i> they wanted. They did not
describe it, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Then how used you it?"</p>

<p>The red blood began to steal up into Tom's cheeks, and he
dropped his eyes and was silent.</p>

<p>"Speak up, good lad, and fear nothing," said the king.
"How used you the Great Seal of England?"</p>

<p>Tom stammered a moment in a pathetic confusion, then got
it out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To crack nuts with!"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3820]</span></p>

<p>Poor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly
swept him off his feet. But if a doubt remained in any mind
that Tom Canty was not the king of England and familiar with
the august appurtenances of royalty, this reply disposed of it
utterly.</p>

<p>Meantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed
from Tom's shoulders to the king's, whose rags were effectually
hidden from sight under it. Then the coronation ceremonies
were resumed; the true king was anointed and the crown set
upon his head, whilst cannon thundered the news to the city,
and all London seemed to rock with applause.</p>

<h2><a name="ARTHUR_HUGH_CLOUGH" id="ARTHUR_HUGH_CLOUGH"></a>ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH</h2>

<h4>(1819-1861)</h4>

<h4>BY CHARLES ELIOT NORTON</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he intellectual mood of many of the finest spirits in England
and New England during the second quarter of the nineteenth
century had something of the nature of a surprise to
themselves, no less than to those who came within their influence.
It was indeed a natural though unforeseen result of forces, various in
kind, that had long been silently at work. The conflicting currents
of thought and moral sentiment, which in all ages perplex and divide
the hearts of men, took a new direction and seemed to have gathered
volume and swiftness. Hardly since the Reformation had there
been so deep and general a stirring of the questions, the answers to
which, whether they be final or merely provisional, involve conclusions
relating to the deepest interests of men. Old convictions were
confronted by new doubts; ancient authority was met by a modern
spirit of independence. This new intellectual mood was perhaps first
distinctly manifest in England in Carlyle's essays, and correspondingly
in New England in the essays and poems of Emerson; it was
expressed in 'In Memoriam' and 'Maud'; it gave the undertone of
Arnold's most characteristic verse, and it found clear and strikingly
distinctive utterance in the poems of Clough. His nature was of rare
superiority alike of character and intellect. His moral integrity and
sincerity imparted clearness to his imagination and strength to his
intelligence, so that while the most marked distinction of his poems
is that which they possess as a mirror of spiritual conditions shared
by many of his contemporaries, they have hardly less interest as the
expression and image of his own individuality.</p>

<p>Arthur Hugh Clough was born at Liverpool on New Year's Day,
1819.<a name="FNanchor_A_426" id="FNanchor_A_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_426" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> His father, who came of an old Welsh family (his mother,
Anne Perfect, was from Yorkshire), had established himself in Liverpool
as a cotton merchant. Toward the end of 1822 he emigrated
with his wife and four children to Charleston, South Carolina, and
here for four years was their home. For Arthur they were important
years. He was a shy, sensitive boy, "already considered as the
genius of the family." He was his mother's darling. She was a
woman "rigidly simple in her tastes and habits, of stern integrity";
of cultivated intelligence, fond of poetry, a lover of nature, and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3822]</span>quickly sympathetic with high character, whether in real life or in
the pages of romance. While his father taught him his Latin grammar
and his arithmetic, his mother read with him from Pope's Iliad
and Odyssey, from Scott's novels and other books fitted to quicken
the imagination. Her influence was strong in the shaping of his
taste and disposition.</p>

<p>In 1828 the family returned for a visit to England, and Arthur
was put to school at Chester, whence in the next year he was transferred
to Rugby. Dr. Arnold had then very lately become the headmaster
at Rugby, and was already giving to the school a tone and
quality unknown previously to the public schools of England. He
strove to impress upon the boys the sense of personal responsibility,
and to rouse their conscience to the doing of duty, not so much as a
matter essential to the discipline of the school as to the formation of
manly and religious character. The influence of his high, vigorous, and
ardent nature was of immense force. But its virtue was impaired
by the artificiality of the ecclesiastical system of the Church of England,
and the irrationality of the dogmatic creed which, even to a
nature as liberal as Dr. Arnold's, seemed to belong to the essentials
of religion, and to be indissoluble from the foundation of morality.</p>

<p>Clough became Arnold's devoted disciple, but he had intellectual
independence and sincerity enough to save him from yielding his
own individuality to any stream of external influence, however powerful.
What he called "the busy argufying spirit of the prize schoolboy"
stood him in good stead. But the moral stress was great, and
it left him early with a sense of strain and of perplexity, as his mind
opened to the wider and deeper problems of life, for the solution of
which the traditional creed seemed insufficient. His career at school
was of the highest distinction; and when he was leaving Rugby for
Oxford in 1836, Dr. Arnold broke the rule of silence to which he
almost invariably adhered in the delivery of prizes, and congratulated
Clough on having gained every honor which Rugby could bestow,
and on having done the highest credit to the school at the University,&mdash;for
he had won the Balliol Scholarship, "then and now the
highest honor which a schoolboy could obtain."</p>

<p>Clough went into residence at Oxford in October, 1837. It was a
time of stirring of heart and trouble of mind at the University. The
great theological controversy which was to produce such far-reaching
effects upon the lives of individuals, and upon the Church of England
as a whole, was then rising to its height. Newman was at the
acme of his popularity and influence. His followers were zealous and
active. Ward, his most earnest disciple, was one of Clough's nearest
friends. Clough, not yet nineteen years old, but morally and intellectually
developed beyond his years and accustomed already to independent
speculation in regard to creed and conduct, was inevitably<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3823]</span>
drawn into the deep waters of theological discussion. He heard, too,
those other voices which Matthew Arnold in his admirable lecture
on Emerson has spoken of as deeply affecting the more sensitive
youthful spirits of the Oxford of this time,&mdash;the voices of Goethe, of
Carlyle, and of Emerson. He studied hard, but his studies seemed,
for the moment at least, to be of secondary importance. Although
unusually reserved in demeanor and silent in general company, his
reputation grew, not merely as a scholar, but as a man distinguished
above his fellows for loftiness of spirit, for sweetness of disposition,
and for superiority of moral no less than of intellectual qualities.
With much interior storm and stress, his convictions were gradually
maturing. He resisted the prevailing tendencies of Oxford thought,
but did not easily find a secure basis for his own beliefs. In 1841 he
tried for and missed his first class in the examinations. It was more
a surprise and disappointment to others than to himself. He knew
that he had not shown himself in the examinations for what he
really was, and his failure did not affect his confidence in his own
powers, nor did others lose faith in him, as was shown by his election
in the next year to a fellowship at Oriel, and the year later to
his appointment as tutor.</p>

<p>His livelihood being thus assured, he led from 1843 to 1848 a
"quiet, hard-working, uneventful tutor's life, diversified with reading
parties" in the vacations. He was writing poems from time to time,
but his vocation as poet was not fully recognized by himself or by
others. He had been obliged, in assuming the duties of tutor, to
sign the Thirty-nine Articles,&mdash;though as he wrote to a friend,
"reluctantly enough, and I am not quite sure whether or not in a
justifiable sense. However, I have for the present laid by that perplexity,
though it may perhaps recur at some time or other; and in
general, I do not feel perfectly satisfied about staying in my tutor
capacity at Oxford."</p>

<p>The perplexity would not down, but as the years went on, the
troubled waters of his soul gradually cleared themselves. He succeeded
in attaining independence of mind such as few men attain,
and in finding, if not a solution of the moral perplexities of life, at
least a position from which they might be frankly confronted without
blinking and without self-deception. It became impossible for
him to accept, however they might be interpreted, the doctrines of
any church. He would not play tricks with words nor palter with
the integrity of his soul. This perfect mental honesty of Clough, and
his entire sincerity of expression, were a stumbling-block to many
of his more conventional contemporaries, and have remained as a
rock of offense to many of the readers of his poetry, who find it disturbing
to be obliged to recognize in his work a test of their own<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3824]</span>
sincerity in dealing with themselves. With how few are conviction
and profession perfectly at one! The difficulty of the struggle in
Clough's case, the difficulty of freeing himself from the chains of
association, of tradition, of affection, of interest, which bound him to
conformity with and acceptance of the popular creed in one or the
other of its forms, has led superficial critics of his life and poetry to
find in them evidence that the struggle was too hard for him and
the result unsatisfactory. There could not be a greater error.
Clough's honest acceptance of the insolubility of the vain questions
which men are perpetually asking, and his recognition of the insufficiency
of the answers which they are ready to accept or to pretend
to accept, left him as regards his most inward soul one of the serenest
of men. The questions of practical life, of action, of duty,
indeed presented themselves to his sensitive and contemplative
nature with their full perplexity; but his spiritual life was based on
a foundation that could not be shaken. He had learned the lesson of
skepticism, and accepted without trouble the fact of the limitation
of human faculties and the insolubility of the mystery of life. He
was indeed tired with the hard work of years, and worried by the
uncertainty of his future; when at length, in order to deliver himself
from a constrained if not a false position, and to obtain perfect
freedom of expression as well as of thought, he resigned in 1848 both
his fellowship and tutorship.</p>

<p>It was a momentous decision, for it left him without any definite
means of support, it alienated the authorities of the University, it
isolated him from many old friends. Immediately after resigning his
tutorship Clough went to Paris with Emerson, then on a visit to
Europe, as his companion. They were drawn thither by interest in
the strange Revolution which was then in progress, and by desire to
watch its aspects. The social conditions of England had long been
matter of concern to Clough. He had been deeply touched by the
misery of the Irish famine in 1847, and had printed a very striking
pamphlet in the autumn of that year, urging upon the students at
Oxford retrenchment of needless expenditure and restrictions of
waste and luxury. His sympathies were with the poor, and he was
convinced of the need of radical social reform. He therefore
observed the course of revolution on the Continent not merely with
curiosity, but with sympathetic hope.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year, after his return home, and while at
Liverpool with his mother and sister, he wrote his first long poem,
'The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich; a Long-Vacation Pastoral.' It had
no great immediate success, but it made him known to a somewhat
wider public than that of Oxford. It was in its form the fruit of the
reading parties in the Highlands in previous summers. It was in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3825]</span>
hexameters, and he asked Emerson to "convey to Mr. Longfellow
the fact that it was a reading of his 'Evangeline' aloud to my
mother and sister, which, coming after a re-perusal of the Iliad,
occasioned this outbreak of hexameters." It is a delightful poem,
full of vitality and variety, original in design, simple in incident. It
has the freshness and wholesomeness of the open air, the charm of
nature and of life, with constant interplay of serious thought and
light humor, of gravity and gayety of sentiment.</p>

<p>Its publication was followed speedily by a little volume entitled
'Ambarvalia,' made up of two parts; one, of poems by Clough, and
one, of those by an old school and college friend, Mr. Burbidge.
Clough's part consisted, as he wrote to Emerson, of "old things, the
casualties of at least ten years." But many of these "casualties" are
characteristic expressions of personal experience, to which Clough's
absolute sincerity gives deep human interest. They are the records
of "his search amid the maze of life for a clue whereby to move."
They deal with the problems of his own life, and these problems
perplex other men as well. "I have seen higher, holier things than
these," he writes in 1841:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have seen higher, holier things than these,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And therefore must to these refuse my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I am panting for a little ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'll take, and so depart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But he checks himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, hold! the heart is prone to fall away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her high and cherished visions to forget;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if thou takest, how wilt thou repay<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So vast, so dread a debt?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The little volume appealed to but a small band of readers. The
poems it contained did not allure by fluency of fancy or richness of
diction; they were not of a kind to win sudden popularity: but they
gave evidence of a poet who, though not complete master of his art,
and not arrived at a complete understanding of himself, had yet a
rare power of reflection and expression and a still rarer sincerity of
imaginative vision. They were poems that gave large promise, and
that promise was already in part fulfilled by the 'Bothie.'</p>

<p>Early in 1849 the headship of University Hall in London was
offered to Clough and accepted by him. This was an institution professedly
non-sectarian, established for the purpose of receiving
students in attendance upon the lectures at University College. He
was not to enter upon the duties of the place until October, and he
spent the greater part of the intervening period in a fruitful visit to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3826]</span>
Italy. He reached Rome in April. All Italy was in revolution. The
Pope had fled from Rome. The Republic had been declared, and
Mazzini was in control of the government. The French army was
approaching to besiege the city, and Clough resolved to await the
event. No more vivid and picturesque account of aspects of the
siege exists than is to be found in his poem of 'Amours de Voyage,'
written in great part at Rome, under the pressure and excitement of
the moment; then laid aside in the poet's desk, and not published
till long afterward. It consists of a series of letters supposed to be
written by various persons, in which a narrative of passing events is
interwoven with a love story. The hero of the story is a creation
of extraordinary subtlety and interest. He has much of the temperament
of Hamlet: not wanting in personal courage, nor in resolution
when forced to action, but hesitating through sensitiveness of conscience,
through dread of mistaking momentary impulse for fixed conviction,
through the clearness with which diverging paths of conduct
present themselves to his imagination, with the inevitable doubt as
to which be the right one to follow. The character, though by no
means an exact or complete image of the poet's own, is yet drawn in
part from himself, and affords glimpses of his inner nature, of the
delicacy of his sensitive poetic spirit, of his tendency to subtle introspective
reflection, of his honesty in dealing with facts and with
himself. To see things as they are, to keep his eyes clear, to be
true to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The living central inmost I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the scales of mere exterior&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was the principle of his life. The charm of 'Amours de Voyage,'
however, consists not merely in animated description, in delicate
sentiment, and in the poetic representation of sensitive, impressionable,
and high-minded youth, but in its delicate humor in the delineation
of character, and in its powerful, imaginative, picturesque
reproduction of the atmosphere and influence of Rome, and of the
spirit of the moment to which the poem relates. It is as unique and
as original in its kind as the 'Bothie.' It is a poem that appeals
strongly to the lovers of the poetry of high culture, and is not likely
to lack such readers in future generations.</p>

<p>From Rome in July Clough went to Naples, and there wrote
another of his most striking poems, 'Easter Day.' In the autumn
of 1850 he again went during a short vacation to Italy, but now
to Venice; and while there began his third long poem, 'Dipsychus,'
of which the scene is in that city. In this poem, which represents
the conflict of the soul in its struggles to maintain itself
against the temptations of the world and the Devil, Clough again<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3827]</span>
wrote out much of his inner life. It is not so much a piece of strict
autobiography of the spirit of an individual, as an imaginative drama
of the spiritual experience common in all times to men of fine nature,
seeking a solution of the puzzle of their own hearts. In none
of his other poems is there such variety of tone, or such an exhibition
of mature poetic power. It is indeed loosely constructed; but its
separate parts, each contributing to the development of its main
theme, with their diversity of imagination, reflection, wit, and sentiment,
combine in an impressive unity of effect.</p>

<p>The position at University Hall proved not altogether satisfactory;
and no other opening for him offering itself in England, Clough
determined after much hesitation and deliberation to try his fortune
as a teacher and writer in America. He sailed in October, 1852, on
a steamer on which he had Lowell and Thackeray for fellow passengers.
He spent the next eight months at Cambridge, employed in
tutoring and in literary work, winning the warm regard of the
remarkable group of men of letters who then gave distinction to the
society of Cambridge and of Boston, and especially keeping up his
friendship with Emerson by frequent visits to Concord. There
seemed a fair prospect of success for him in his new career. But his
friends at home, deeply attached to him, and ill content that he
should leave them, obtained for him an appointment as examiner in
the Education Department of the Council Office. The salary would
give to him a secure though moderate income. He was the more
drawn to accept the place, because shortly before leaving England he
had become engaged to be married; and accordingly in July, 1853, he
returned home and at once entered on the duties of his office. In
June 1854 he married. For the next seven years his life was tranquil,
laborious, and happy. The account of these years contained in
the beautiful sketch of his life by his wife, which is prefixed to the
collection of his 'Letters, Poems and Prose Remains,'<a name="FNanchor_B_427" id="FNanchor_B_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_427" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> gives a
picture of Clough's domestic felicity, and of the various interests
which engaged him outside of the regular drudgery of official work.
His own letters bear witness to the content of his days. He had
little leisure for poetry. He was overworked, and in 1860 his health
gave way. Leave of absence from the office was given to him. He
went to the seashore; he visited the Continent: but though at times
he seemed to gain strength, there was no steady recovery. In the
autumn of 1861 he went to Italy, accompanied by his wife; he
enjoyed the journey, but they had only reached the Lakes when he
experienced a touch of fever. They went on to Florence; he became
more seriously ill. He began however apparently to recover, but a
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3828]</span>sudden blow of paralysis struck him down, and on the 13th day of
November he died.</p>

<p>Among the most original and beautiful of Matthew Arnold's poems
is his 'Thyrsis, a Monody,' to commemorate his friend Arthur Hugh
Clough. Thyrsis his mate has gone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No purer or more subtle soul"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>than he ever sought the light that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"leaves its seeker still untired,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still onward faring by his own heart inspired."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lament is as true as it is tender. The singer continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What though the music of thy rustic flute<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Kept not for long its happy country tone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost it too soon, and learnt a stormy note<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of men contention-tost, of men who groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which tasked thy pipe too sore, and tired thy throat,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It failed, and thou wast mute!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hadst thou always visions of our light."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, always visions of the light! But Arnold's usual felicity of
discrimination is lacking in this last stanza. The stormy note is not
the characteristic note of Clough's mature song, nor does his art
betray the overtasked pipe. His pipe indeed is not attuned, as was
Arnold's own, to the soft melancholy of regret at leaving behind the
happy fields of the past in the quest for the light that shines beyond
and across the untraveled and dim waste before them; its tone was
less pathetic, but not less clear. The music of each is the song of
travelers whose road is difficult, whose goal is uncertain. Their only
guide is the fugitive light, now faint, now distinct, which allures
them with irresistible compulsion. Their pathways at times diverge;
but when most divergent, the notes of their accordant pipes are
heard in the same direction.</p>

<p>The memory of Clough remains, with those who had the happiness
of knowing him in life, distinct and precious. It is that of one
of the highest and purest souls. Sensitive, simple, tender, manly,
his figure stands as one of the ideal figures of the past, the image of
the true poet, the true friend, the true man. He died too young for
his full fame, but not too young for the love which is better than
fame.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">amuel Taylor Coleridge, the English poet and philosopher,
was born at Ottery St. Mary, in Devonshire, October 21st,
1772. He was the ninth and youngest son of the vicar of
the parish,&mdash;a man characterized by learning and also by some of its
foibles,&mdash;under whose care he passed his childhood; but on the death
of his father he was sent up to London to be educated at Christ's
Hospital, and there spent, in companionship with Lamb, his school
days from 1782 to 1791. He went in the latter year to Jesus College
Cambridge. His career as an undergraduate was marked by an escapade,&mdash;his
enlistment in the King's Regiment of Light Dragoons in
the winter of 1793-94, from which he was released by the influence
of his relatives; and in more important ways by his friendship with
Southey, whom he found on a visit to Oxford, and his engagement
to Sarah Fricker in the summer of 1794. He had already been attached
to another young lady, Mary Evans, with whose family he
had been intimate. In December 1794 he left Cambridge without
taking a degree, and on October 21st, 1795, he was married. His
biography from this point is one of confused and intricate detail,
which only a long story could set forth plainly and exactly. Its
leading external events were a residence in Germany in 1798-99 and
a voyage to Malta, with travel in Sicily and Italy in 1804-6; in its
inward development, the turning-points of his life were his first intimacy
with the Wordsworths in 1797, during which his best poems
were composed; his subjection to the opium habit, with increasing
domestic unhappiness, in 1801-2; and his retreat under medical control
to Highgate in 1816. He was practically separated from his
family from the time of his voyage to Malta. Troubles of many
kinds filled all these years, but he had always a power to attract
friends who were deeply interested in his welfare, and he was never
without admirers and helpers. Before he withdrew to Highgate he
had resided first at Stowey in the neighborhood of Tom Poole, and
later at Greta Hall near the Wordsworths; but he was often away
from home, and after he ceased to be an inmate there, from 1806 to
1816, he led a wandering life, either in lodgings frequently changed,
or in visits to his friends. His resources were always small, and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3844]</span>
from the start his friends were his patrons, making up subscriptions,
loans, and gifts for him; in 1798 the Wedgwoods gave him a pension
of &pound;150 for life, which was soon secured for the support of his family,
and in 1812 one-half of this was withdrawn; in 1825 he was
granted a royal pension of one hundred guineas, and when this
lapsed in 1830 Frere made it up to him. De Quincey had distinguished
himself by an act of singular and impulsive generosity to
him, upon first acquaintance. He was always cared for, though his
indulgence in opium made it difficult for those who knew the fact to
assist him directly in a wise way. His pecuniary embarrassment,
however, was constant and trying during a great part of his life; his
own wretchedness of spirit, under the painful conditions of his bodily
state and his moral as well as material position, was very great; but
through all these sufferings and trials he maintained sufficient energy
to leave behind him a considerable body of literary work. He died
July 25th, 1834.</p>

<p>The poetic genius of Coleridge, the highest of his many gifts,
found brilliant and fascinating expression.  His poems&mdash;those in
which his fame lives&mdash;are as unique as they are memorable; and
though their small number, their confined range, and the brief
period during which his faculty was exercised with full freedom
and power, seem to indicate a narrow vein, yet the remainder of
his work in prose and verse leaves an impression of extraordinary
and abundant intellectual force. In proportion as his imaginative
creations stand apart, the spirit out of which they came must have
possessed some singularity: and if the reader is not content with
simple aesthetic appreciation of what the gods provide, but has some
touch of curiosity leading him to look into the source of such remarkable
achievement and its human history, he is at once interested
in the personality of the "subtle-souled psychologist," as
Shelley with his accurate critical insight first named him; in experiencing
the fascination of the poetry one remembers the charm
which Coleridge had in life, that quality which arrested attention
in all companies and drew men's minds and hearts with a sense of
something marvelous in him&mdash;"the most wonderful man," said
Wordsworth, "that I ever met." The mind and heart of Coleridge,
his whole life, have been laid open by himself and his friends and
acquaintances without reserve in many volumes of letters and memoirs;
it is easy to figure him as he lived and to recover his moods
and aspect: but in order to conceive his nature and define its traits,
it is necessary to take account especially of his incomplete and less
perfect work, of his miscellaneous interests, and those activities
which filled and confused his life without having any important
share in establishing his fame.</p>

<p>The intellectual precocity which is the leading trait of Coleridge's
boyhood, in the familiar portrait of "the inspired charity-boy" drawn
by Lamb from schoolboy memories, is not unusual in a youth of
genius; but the omnivorousness of knowledge which he then displayed
continued into his manhood. He consumed vast quantities of
book-learning. It is a more remarkable characteristic that from the
earliest period in which he comes into clear view, he was accustomed
to give out his ideas with freedom in an inexhaustible stream of
talk. The activity of his mind was as phenomenal as its receptivity.
In his college days, too, he was fanatical in all his energies. The
remark of Southey after Shelley's visit to him, that here was a
young man who was just what he himself had been in his college
days, is illustrative; for if Southey was then inflamed with radicalism,
Coleridge was yet more deeply infected and mastered by that
wild fever of the revolutionary dawn. The tumult of Coleridge's
mind, its incessant action, the lack of discipline in his thought, of
restraint in his expression, of judgment in his affairs, are all important
elements in his character at a time which in most men would be
called the formative period of manhood, but which in him seems to
have been intensely chaotic; what is most noticeable, however, is the
volume of his mental energy. He expressed himself, too, in ways
natural to such self-abundance. He was always a discourser, if the
name may be used, from the London days at the "Salutation and
the Cat" of which Lamb tells, saying that the landlord was ready to
retain him because of the attraction of his conversation for customers;
and as he went on to the more set forms of such monologue,
he became a preacher without pay in Unitarian chapels, a journalist
with unusual capacity for ready and sonorous writing in the press, a
composer of whole periodicals such as his ventures The Watchman
and The Friend, and a lecturer using only slight notes as the material
of his remarks upon literature, education, philosophy, theology, or
whatever the subject might be. In all these methods of expression
which he took up one after the other, he merely talked in an ample
way upon multifarious topics; in the conversation, sermon, leading
article, written discourse, or flowing address, he was master of a
swelling and often brilliant volubility, but he had neither the certainty
of the orator nor the unfailing distinction of the author;
there was an occasional and impromptu quality, a colloquial and
episodical manner, the style of the irresponsible speaker. In his
earlier days especially, the dominant note in Coleridge's whole
nature was excitement. He was always animated, he was often violent,
he was always without the principle of control. Indeed, a
weakness of moral power seems to have been congenital, in the
sense that he was not permanently bound by a practical sense of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3846]</span>
duty nor apparently observant of what place duty has in real life.
There was misdirection of his affairs from the time when they came
into his own hands; there was impulsiveness, thoughtlessness, a lack
of judgment which augured ill for him; and in its total effect this
amounted to folly. His intoxication with the scheme known as Pantisocracy,
by which he with Southey and a few like-minded projectors
were to found a socialistic community on the banks of the
Susquehanna, is the most obvious comment on his practical sense.
But his marriage, with the anecdotes of its preliminaries (one of
which was that in those colloquies with Lamb at the London tavern,
so charmingly described by his boon companion, he had forgotten
his engagement or was indifferent to it), more strikingly exemplifies
the irresponsible course of his life, more particularly as it proved to
be ill-sorted, full of petty difficulties and makeshift expedients, and
in the end a disastrous failure. A radical social scheme and an imprudent
marriage might have fallen to his share of human folly,
however, without exciting remark, if in other ways or at a later
time he had exhibited the qualities which would allow one to dismiss
these matters as mere instances of immaturity; but wherever Coleridge's
reasonable control over himself or his affairs is looked to, it
appears to have been feeble. On the other hand, the constancy of
his excitement is plain. It was not only mental, but physical. He
was, as a young man, full of energy and capable of a good deal of
hard exercise; he had animal spirits, and Wordsworth describes him
as "noisy" and "gamesome," as one who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His limbs would toss about him with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like branches when strong winds the trees annoy;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and from several passages of his own writing, which are usually disregarded,
the evidence of a spirit of rough humor and fun is easily
obtained. The truth is that Coleridge changed a great deal in his
life; he felt himself to be very different in later years from what
he was in the time when to his memory even he was a sort of glorified
spirit: and this earlier Coleridge had many traits which are
ignored sometimes, as Carlyle ignored them, and are sometimes
remembered rather as idealizations of his friends in their affectionate
thoughts of him, but in any event are irreconcilable with the figure
of the last period of his life.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that there was something of disease or at
least of ill health in Coleridge always, and that it should be regarded
as influencing his temperament. Whether it were so or not, the plea
itself shows the fact. If excitement was the dominant note, as has
been said, in his whole nature, it could not exist without a physical
basis and accompaniment; and his bodily state appears to have been<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3847]</span>
often less one of animation than of agitation, and his correspondence
frequently discloses moods that seem almost frantic. In the issue,
under stress of pain and trouble, he became an opium-eater; but his
physical nature may fairly be described as predisposed to such states
as lead to the use of opium and also result from its use, with the
attendant mental moods. His susceptibility to sensuous impressions,
to a voluptuousness of the entire being, together with a certain lassitude
and languor, lead to the same conclusion, which thus seems to be
supported on all sides,&mdash;that Coleridge was, in his youth and early
manhood, fevered through all his intellectual and sensuous nature,
and deficient on the moral and practical sides in those matters that
related to his personal affairs. It is desirable to bring this out in
plain terms, because in Coleridge it is best to acknowledge at once
that his character was, so far as our part&mdash;the world's part&mdash;in
him is concerned, of less consequence than his temperament; a
subtler and more profound thing than character, though without
moral meaning. It is not unfair to say, since literature is to be
regarded most profitably as the expression of human personality,
that with Coleridge the modern literature of temperament, as it has
been lately recognized in extreme phases, begins; not that temperament
is a new thing in the century now closing, nor that it has
been without influence hitherto, but that now it is more often considered,
and has in fact more often been, an exclusive ground of
artistic expression. The temperament of Coleridge was one of diffused
sensuousness physically, and of abnormal mental moods,&mdash;moods
of weakness, languor, collapse, of visionary imaginative life
with a night atmosphere of the spectral, moonlit, swimming, scarcely
substantial world; and the poems he wrote, which are the contributions
he made to the world's literature, are based on this temperament,
like some Fata Morgana upon the sea. The apparent exclusion
of reality from the poems in which his genius was most manifest
finds its analogue in the detachment of his own mind from the
moral, the practical, the usual in life as he led it in his spirit; and
his work of the highest creative sort, which is all there is to his
enduring fame, stands amid his prose and verse composition of a
lower sort like an island in the waste of waters. This may be best
shown, perhaps, by a gradual approach through his cruder to his
more perfect compositions.</p>

<p>The cardinal fact in Coleridge's genius is that notwithstanding his
immense sensuous susceptibilities and mental receptivity, and the
continual excitement of his spirit, he never rose into the highest
sphere of creative activity except for the brief period called his
<i>annus mirabilis</i>, when his great poems were written; and with this is
the further related fact that in him we witness the spectacle of the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3848]</span>
imaginative instinct overborne and supplanted by the intellectual faculty
exercising its speculative and critical functions; and in addition,
one observes in his entire work an extraordinary inequality not only
of treatment, but also of subject-matter. In general, he was an egoistic
writer. His sensitiveness to nature was twofold: in the first
place he noticed in the objects and movements of nature evanescent
and minute details, and as his sense of beauty was keen, he saw and
recorded truly the less obvious and less common loveliness in the
phenomena of the elements and the seasons, and this gave distinction
to his mere description and record of fact; in the second place
he often felt in himself moods induced by nature, but yet subjective,&mdash;states
of his own spirit, which sometimes deepened the charm of
night, for example, by his enjoyment of its placid aspects, and sometimes
imparted to the external world a despair reflected from his
personal melancholy. In his direct treatment of nature, however,
as Mr. Stopford Brooke points out, he seldom achieves more than a
catalogue of his sensations, which though touched with imaginative
detail are never lifted and harmonized into lyrical unity; though he
can moralize nature in Wordsworth's fashion, when he does so the
result remains Wordsworth's and is stamped with that poet's originality;
and in his own original work Coleridge never equaled either
the genius of Shelley, who can identify nature with himself, or the
charm of Tennyson, who can at least parallel nature's phenomena
with his own human moods.  Coleridge would not be thought of as
a poet of nature, except in so far as he describes what he observes
in the way of record, or gives a metaphysical interpretation to phenomena.
This is the more remarkable because he had to an eminent
degree that intellectual power, that overmastering desire of the mind,
to rationalize the facts of life.  It was this quality that made him a
philosopher, an analyst, a critic on the great lines of Aristotle, seeking
to impose an order of ethics and metaphysics on all artistic productions.
But in those poems in which he describes nature directly
and without metaphysical thought, there is no trace of anything
more than a sensuous order of his own perceptions.  Beautiful and
often unique as his nature poems are, they are not creative.  They
are rather in the main autobiographic; and it is surprising to notice
how large a proportion of his verse is thus autobiographic, not in
those phases of his own life which may be, or at least are thought
of as representative of human life in the mass, but which are personal,
such as the lines written after hearing Wordsworth read the
'Prelude,' or those entitled 'Dejection.' When his verse is not confined
to autobiographic expression, it is often a product of his interest
in his friends or in his family. What is not personal in it, of this
sort, is apt to be domestic or social.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3849]</span></p>
<p>If we turn from the poems of nature to those concerned with
man, a similar shallowness, either of interest or of power, appears.
He was in early years a radical; he was stirred by the Revolution in
France, and he was emotionally charged with the ideas of the time,&mdash;ideas
of equality, fraternity, and liberty. But this interest died
out, as is shown by his political verse. He had none but a social
and a philosophical interest in any case. Man, the individual, did not
at any time attract him. There was nothing dramatic in his genius,
in the narrow and exact sense: he did not engage his curiosity or
his philosophy in individual fortunes. It results from this limitation
that his verse lacks human interest of the dramatic kind. The truth
was that he was interested in thought rather than in deeds, in
human nature rather than in its concrete pity and terror. Thus he
did not seize on life itself as the material of his imagination and
reflection. In the case of man as in the case of nature he gives us
only an egoistic account, telling us of his own private fortune, his
fears, pains, and despairs, but only as a diary gives them; as he did
not transfer his nature impressions into the world of creative art,
so he did not transfer his personal experiences into that world.</p>

<p>What has been said would perhaps be accepted, were it not for
the existence of those poems, 'The Ancient Mariner,' 'Christabel,'
'Kubla Khan,' which are the marvelous creations of his genius. In
these it will be said there is both a world of nature new created, and
a dramatic method and interest. It is enough for the purpose of the
analysis if it be granted that nowhere else in Coleridge's work,
except in these and less noticeably in a few other instances, do these
high characteristics occur. The very point which is here to be
brought out is that Coleridge applied that intellectual power, that
overmastering desire of the mind to rationalize the phenomena of
life, which has been mentioned as his great mental trait,&mdash;that he
applied this faculty with different degrees of power at different
times, so that his poetry falls naturally into higher and inferior
categories; in the autobiographic verse, in the political and dramatic
verse which forms so large a part of his work, it appears that he
did not have sufficient feeling or exercise sufficient power to raise it
out of the lower levels of composition; in his great works of constructive
and impersonal art, of moral intensity or romantic beauty
and fascination, he did so exercise the creative imagination as to
make these of the highest rank, or at least one of them.</p>

<p>'The Ancient Mariner,' apart from its many minor merits, has
this distinction in Coleridge's work,&mdash;it is a poem of perfect unity.
'Christabel' is a fragment, 'Kubla Khan' is a glimpse; and though
the 'Ode to France,' 'Love, Youth, and Age,' and possibly a few
other short pieces, have this highest artistic virtue of unity, yet in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3850]</span>
them it is of a simpler kind. 'The Ancient Mariner,' on the other
hand, is a marvel of construction in that its unity is less complex
than manifold; it exists, however the form be examined.  In the
merely external sense, the telling of the tale to the Wedding
Guest, with the fact that the wedding is going on, gives it unity; in
the merely internal sense, the moral lesson of the salvation of the
slayer of the albatross by the medium of love felt toward living
things, subtly yet lucidly worked out as the notion is, gives it unity;
but in still other ways, as a story of connected and consequential
incidents with a plot, a change of fortune, a climax, and the other
essentials of this species of tale-telling, it has unity; and if its
conception either of the physical or the ethical world be analyzed,
these too&mdash;and these are the fundamental things&mdash;are found consistent
wholes.  It nevertheless remains true that this system of
nature as a vitalized but not humanized mode of life, with its bird,
its spirit, its magical powers, is not the nature that we know or
believe to be,&mdash;it is a modern presentation of an essentially primitive
and animistic belief; and similarly this system of human life,&mdash;if the
word human can be applied to it, with its dead men, its skeleton
ship, its spirit sailors, its whole miracle of spectral being,&mdash;is not the
life we know or believe to be: it is an incantation, a simulacrum.
It may still be true therefore that the imaginative faculty of Coleridge
was not applied either to nature or human life, in the ordinary
sense.  And this it is that constitutes the uniqueness of the poem,
and its wonderful fascination.  Coleridge fell heir, by the accidents
of time and the revolutions of taste, to the ballad style, its simplicity,
directness, and narrative power; he also was most attracted
to the machinery of the supernatural, the weird, the terrible, almost
to the grotesque and horrid, as these literary motives came into
fashion in the crude beginnings of romanticism in our time; his
subtle mind, his fine senses, his peculiar susceptibility to the mystic
and shadowy in nature,&mdash;as shown by his preference of the moonlight,
dreamy, or night aspects of real nature, to its brilliant beauties
in the waking world,&mdash;gave him ease and finesse in the handling
of such subject-matter; and he lived late enough to know that all
this eerie side of human experience and imaginative capacity,
inherited from primeval ages but by no means yet deprived of
plausibility, could be effectively used only as an allegoric or scenic
setting of what should be truth to the ethical sense; he combined
one of the highest lessons of advanced civilization, one of the last
results of spiritual perception,&mdash;the idea of love toward life in any
form,&mdash;with the animistic beliefs and supernatural fancies of the
crude ages of the senses. This seems to be the substantial matter;
and in this he was, to repeat Shelley's phrase, the "subtle-souled<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3851]</span>
psychologist." The material of his imagination, on the sensuous
side, was of the slightest: it was the supernaturalism of the romantic
movement, somewhat modified by being placed in connection with
the animal world; and he put this to use as a means of illustrating
spiritual truth. He thus became the first of those who have employed
the supernatural in our recent literature without losing credence for
it, as an allegory of psychological states, moral facts, or illusions real
to the eye that sees them and having some logical relation to the
past of the individual; of such writers Hawthorne and Poe are eminent
examples, and both of them, it may be remarked, are writers
in whom temperament rather than character is the ground of their
creative work. The intimate kinship between imagination so directed
and the speculative philosophical temper is plain to see. In 'Christabel'
on the other hand, the moral substance is not apparent: the
place filled by the moral ideas which are the centres of the narrative
in 'The Ancient Mariner,' is taken here by emotional situations;
but the supernaturalism is practically the same in both poems, and
in both is associated with that mystery of the animal world to man,
most concentrated and vivid in the fascination ascribed traditionally
to the snake, which is the animal motive in 'Christabel' as the
goodness of the albatross in the 'The Ancient Mariner.' In these
poems the good and the bad omens that ancient augurs minded are
made again dominant over men's imagination. Such are the signal
and unique elements in these poems, which have besides that wealth
of beauty in detail, of fine diction, of liquid melody, of sentiment,
thought, and image, which belong only to poetry of the highest
order, and which are too obvious to require any comment. 'Kubla
Khan' is a poem of the same kind, in which the mystical effect is
given almost wholly by landscape; it is to 'The Ancient Mariner'
and 'Christabel' what protoplasm is to highly organized cells.</p>

<p>If it be recognized then that the imagery of Coleridge in the
characteristic parts of these cardinal poems is as pure allegory, is as
remote from nature or man, as is the machinery of fairy-land and
chivalry in Spenser, for example, and he obtains credibility by the
psychological and ethical truth presented in this imagery, it is not
surprising that his work is small in amount; for the method is not
only a difficult one, but the poetic machinery itself is limited and
meagre. The poverty of the subject-matter is manifest, and the restrictions
to its successful use are soon felt. It may well be doubted
whether 'Christabel' would have gained by being finished. In 'The
Ancient Mariner' the isolation of the man is a great advantage; if
there had been any companion for him, the illusion could not have
been entire: as it is, what he experiences has the wholeness and
truth within itself of a dream, or of a madman's world,&mdash;there is no<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3852]</span>
standard of appeal outside of his own senses and mind, no real
world; but in 'Christabel' the serpentine fable goes on in a world of
fact and action, and as soon as the course of the story involved this
fable in the probabilities and actual occurences of life, it might well
be that the tale would have turned into one of simple enchantment
and magic, as seems likely from what has been told of its continuation;
certainly it could not have equaled the earlier poem, or have
been in the same kind with it, unless the unearthly magic, the spell,
were finally completely dissolved into the world of moral truth as is
the case with 'The Ancient Mariner.' Coleridge found it still more
impossible to continue 'Kubla Khan.' It seems a fair inference to
conclude that Coleridge's genius, however it suffered from the misfortunes
and ills of his life, was in these works involved in a field,
however congenial, yet of narrow range and infertile in itself. In
poetic style it is to be observed that he kept what he had gained;
the turbid diction of the earlier period never came back to trouble
him, and the cadences he had formed still gave their music to his
verse. The change, the decline, was not in his power of style; it
was in his power of imagination, if at all, but the fault may have
laid in the capacities of the subject-matter. A similar thing certainly
happened in his briefer ballad poetry, in that of which 'Love,' 'The
Three Graces,' 'Alice Du Clos,' and 'The Dark Ladie,' are examples;
the matter there, the machinery of the romantic ballad, was no
longer capable of use; that sort of literature was dead from the
exhaustion of its motives. The great 'Ode to France,' in which he
reached his highest point of eloquent and passionate expression,
seems to mark the extinction in himself of the revolutionary impulse.
On the whole, while the excellence of much of the remainder of his
verse, even in later years, is acknowledged, and its originality in
several instances, may it not be that in his greatest work Coleridge
came to an end because of an impossibility in the kind itself? The
supernatural is an accessory rather than a main element in the interpretation
of life which literary genius undertakes; Coleridge so
subordinates it here by making it contributory to a moral truth; but
such a practice would seem to be necessarily incidental to a poet
who was also so intellectual as Coleridge, and not to be adopted as
a permanent method of self-expression.</p>

<p>From whatever cause, the fact was that Coleridge ceased to create
in poetry, and fell back on that fluent, manifold, voluminous faculty
he possessed of absorbing and giving out ideas in vast quantities, as
it were by bulk. He attended especially to the theory of art as he
found it illustrated in the greatest poets, and he popularized among
literary men a certain body of doctrine regarding criticism, its
growth and methods; and in later years he worked out metaphysical<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3853]</span>
theological views which he inculcated in ways which won for him
recognition as a practical influence in contemporary church opinion.
In these last years of his lecturing and discoursing in private, the
figure he makes is pathetic, though Carlyle describes it with a grim
humor, as any one may read in the 'Life of Sterling': over against
that figure should be set the descriptions of the young Coleridge by
Dorothy Wordsworth and Lamb; and after these perhaps the contrast
which Coleridge himself draws between his spirit and his body may
enable a reader to fuse the two&mdash;youth and age&mdash;into one. Whatever
were the weaknesses of his nature and the trials of his life, of
which one keeps silent, he was deeply loved by friends of many
different minds, who if they grew cold, had paid at least once this
tribute to the charm, the gentleness, and the delight of his human
companionship.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">here is much to inspire regretful sympathy in the short life
of William Collins. He was born at Chichester, and received
his education at Winchester College and at Magdalen College,
Oxford. A delicate, bookish boy, he had every stimulus toward
a literary career. With a fine appreciation of beauty in all forms of
art, and a natural talent for versification, he wrote poems of much
promise when very young. His 'Persian Eclogues' appeared when
he was only seventeen. Then Collins showed his impatient spirit and
fickleness of purpose by deserting his work
at Oxford and going to London with the
intention of authorship. His head was full
of brilliant schemes,&mdash;too full; for with
him as with most people, conception was
always easier than execution. But finding
it far more difficult to win fame than he
anticipated, he had not courage to persevere,
and fell into dissipated, extravagant
ways which soon exhausted his small
means.</p>

<p>In 1746 he published the 'Odes, Descriptive
and Allegorical,' his most characteristic
work. They were never widely read,
and it took the public some time to appreciate
their lyric fervor, their exquisite imagery, and their musical
verse. In spite of occasional obscurities induced by careless treatment,
they are among the finest of English odes. His love for
nature and sympathy with its calmer aspects is very marked. Speaking
of the 'Ode to Evening,' Hazlitt says that "the sounds steal
slowly over the ear like the gradual coming on of evening itself."
According to Swinburne, the 'Odes' do not contain "a single false
note." "Its grace and vigor, its vivid and pliant dexterity of touch,"
he says of the 'Ode to the Passions,' "are worthy of their long
inheritance of praise."</p>

<p>But the inheritance did not come at once, although Collins has
always received generous praise from fellow poets. His mortified
self-love resented lack of success. With a legacy bequeathed him by
an uncle he bought his book back from the publisher Millar, and the
unsold impressions he burned in "angry despair."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3872]</span></p>
<p>Meantime he went on planning works quite beyond his power of
execution. He advertised 'Proposals for a History of the Revival of
Learning,' which he never wrote. He began several tragedies, but
his indolent genius would not advance beyond devising the plots. As
he was always wasteful and dissipated, he was continually in debt.
In spite of his unusual gifts, he had not the energy and self-control
necessary for adequate literary expression. Dr. Johnson, who admired
and tried to befriend him, found a bailiff prowling around the
premises when he went to call. At his instigation a bookseller
advanced money to get Collins out of London, for which in return
he was to translate Aristotle's 'Poetics' and to write a commentary.
Probably he never fulfilled the agreement. Indeed, he had some
excuse. "A man doubtful of his dinners, or trembling at a creditor,
is not disposed to abstract meditation or remote inquiries," comments
Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p>Collins was always weak of body, and when still a young man
was seized by mental disease. Weary months of despondency were
succeeded by madness, until he was, as Dr. Wharton describes it,
with "every spark of imagination extinguished, and with only the
faint traces of memory and reason left." Then the unhappy poet was
taken to Chichester and cared for by a sister. There he who had
loved music so passionately hated the cathedral organ in his madness,
and when he heard it, howled in distress.</p>

<p>Among the best examples of his verse, besides the poems already
mentioned, are the 'Dirge to Cymbeline,' 'Ode to Fear,' and the
'Ode on the Poetical Character,' which Hazlitt calls "the best of
all."</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_WILKIE_COLLINS" id="WILLIAM_WILKIE_COLLINS"></a>WILLIAM WILKIE COLLINS</h2>

<h4>(1824-1889)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capw.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ilkie Collins has proved that the charm of a story does not
necessarily depend upon the depiction of character or an
appeal to the sympathies. As he said:&mdash;"I have always
held the old-fashioned opinion that the primary object of a work of
fiction should be to tell a story." He also aspired to draw living
men and women, in which he was less successful. Count Fosco, Miss
Gwilt, Armadale, Laura Fairlie, and others, are indeed distinct;
but the interest centres not on them but on the circumstances in
which they are involved. This is the main
reason why the critics, even in admiring
his talent, speak of Collins with faint depreciation,
as certainly not one of the
greatest novelists of the century, although
holding a place of his own which forces
recognition. For novel-readers have delighted
in his many volumes in spite of the
critics, and there is a steady demand for
the old favorites. Translated into French,
Italian, Danish, and Russian, many of them
continue to inspire the same interest in
foreign lands.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">
<img src="images/wilkie.jpg" width="168" height="206" alt="Wilkie Collins" title="Wilkie Collins" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Wilkie Collins</span></span>
</div>

<p>Wilkie Collins, born January 8th, 1824,
did not show any special precocity in boyhood
and youth. He probably learned much more from his self-guided
reading than from his schooling at Highbury, especially after
his acquisition of French and Italian during two years in Italy in his
early teens. The influences about him were strongly artistic. His
father, William Collins, was distinguished as a landscape painter.
The well-known portrait painter Mrs. Carpenter was his aunt, and
the distinguished Scotch artist David Wilkie his godfather. But
human action and emotion interested him more than art. He was
very young when he expressed a desire to write, and perpetrated
blank verse which justified his father in vigorous opposition to his
adoption of authorship as a profession. So, his school days ended,
he presented the not unusual figure of a bright young Englishman
who must earn his bread, yet had no particular aptitude for doing it.
He tried business first, and became articled clerk with a City house<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3880]</span>
in the tea trade. But the work was uncongenial; and after a few
unsatisfactory years he fell in with his father's views, and was entered
at Lincoln's Inn and in due time admitted to the bar, although he
never practiced law.</p>

<p>He continued writing for amusement, however, producing sketches
and stories valuable as training. On his father's death he prepared
a biography of that artist in two volumes (1848), which was considered
a just as well as a loving appreciation. His first novel, however,
was rejected by every publisher to whom he submitted it. His
second, 'Antonina,' a story of the fall of Rome, was mediocre.
He was about twenty-six when he met Charles Dickens, then a
man of forty, at the height of his fame, and with the kindliest feeling
for younger writers still struggling for recognition. Dickens,
whose own work was always prompted by sympathetic intuition, and
to whom character development came more easily than ingenious
plots, cordially admired Collins's skill in devising and explaining the
latter. He invited the younger man to become collaborator upon
Household Words, and thus initiated a warm friendship which
lasted until his own death. Encouraged by him, Collins essayed
drama and wrote 'The Light-House,' played at Gadshill by distinguished
amateurs, Dickens himself among them. At first thought,
his would seem an essentially dramatic talent, and several of his
novels have been successfully dramatized. But the very cleverness
and intricacy of his situations make them unsuited to the stage.
They are too difficult of comprehension to be taken in at a glance
by an average audience, in the swift passage of stage action.</p>

<p>It was also the influence of Dickens which inspired Collins to
attempt social reform. In 'Man and Wife' he tries to show the
injustice of Scotch marriage laws; in 'The New Magdalen,' the possible
regeneration of fallen women; in 'Heart and Science,' the
abuses of vivisection; and other stories are incumbered with didactic
purpose. Mr. Swinburne comments upon this aspect of his career in
a jocular couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What brought good Wilkie's genius nigh perdition?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some demon whispered, 'Wilkie! have a mission!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But in all "tendency" novels it is not the discussion of problems
that makes them live; and Wilkie Collins, like others, survives by
purely literary qualities. Soon after his death the critic of the Spectator
gave the following capable summary of his peculiar method:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was a literary chess player of the first force, with power of carrying
his plan right through the game and making every move tell. His method
was to introduce a certain number of characters, set before them a well-defined
object, such as the discovery of a secret, the re-vindication of a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3881]</span>
fortune, the tracking of a crime, or the establishment of a doubted marriage,
and then bring in other characters to resist or counterplot their
efforts. Each side makes moves, almost invariably well-considered and
promising moves; the counter-moves are equally good; the interest goes on
accumulating till the looker-on&mdash;the reader is always placed in that attitude&mdash;is
rapt out of himself by strained attention; and then there is a sudden
and totally unexpected mate. It is chess which is being played; and in the
best of all his stories, the one which will live for years,&mdash;'The Moonstone,'&mdash;the
pretense that it is anything else is openly disregarded."</p>

<p>This analysis however must not be too narrowly construed, as
petty critics often do, to mean that the only interest in Mr.
Collins's novels is that of disentangling the plot. If this were so, no
one would read them more than once; while in fact the best of them
are eminently readable again and again. This shallow judgment
evidently galled the novelist himself, and 'The New Magdalen' in
one aspect was a throwing-down of the gauntlet to the critics; for in
it he tells the plot page by page, almost paragraph by paragraph,
as he goes along, and even far in advance of the story, yet it is one
of the most fascinating of his novels. He proved that he could do
admirably what they said he could not do at all&mdash;make people read
his story with breathless absorption when they knew its end long
before they came to it; and it was as interesting backward as forward.
'No Name' is in some sort a combination of the two methods,&mdash;a
revelation of the end, with perpetual interest in the discovery of
means.</p>

<p>'The Moonstone' and 'The Woman in White' are unquestionably
his masterpieces. In both he throws light upon a complex plot by
means of his favorite expedient of letters and diaries written by
different characters, who thus take the reader into their confidence
and bewilder him with conflicting considerations, until the author
comes forward with an ingenious and lucid solution. 'The Moonstone,'
however, is immensely superior in matter even to its fellow;
its plot is better (in one place 'The Woman in White' comes to a
dead wall which the author calmly ignores and goes on), and some
passages are worth reading over and over for pure pathos or description.
Mr. Collins was in fact, aside from his special gift, a literary
artist of no mean power, even if not the highest: with an eye for
salient effects, a skill in touching the more obvious chords of
emotion, a knowledge of life and books, that enrich his stories with
enough extraneous wealth to prolong their life for many years, and
some of them perhaps for generations.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SLEEP-WALKING" id="THE_SLEEP-WALKING"></a>THE SLEEP-WALKING</h3>

<h4>From 'The Moonstone'</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[This episode is related by the physician in charge of Mr. Franklin Blake,
whose good name he wishes to clear from a charge of fraud.]</p></div>

<p>Two o'clock A.M.&mdash;The experiment has been tried. With what
result I am now to describe.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock I rang the bell for Betteredge and
told Mr. Blake that he might at last prepare himself for bed.... I
followed Betteredge out of the room, and told him
to remove the medicine chest into Miss Verinder's sitting-room.</p>

<p>The order seemed to take him completely by surprise. He
looked as if he suspected me of some occult design on Miss
Verinder! "Might I presume to ask," he said, "what my
young lady and the medicine chest have got to do with each
other?"</p>

<p>"Stay in the sitting-room and you will see."</p>

<p>Betteredge appeared to doubt his own unaided capacity to
superintend me effectually, on an occasion when a medicine
chest was included in the proceedings.</p>

<p>"Is there any objection, sir," he asked, "to taking Mr.
Bruff into this part of the business?"</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary! I am now going to ask Mr. Bruff to
accompany me down-stairs."</p>

<p>Betteredge withdrew to fetch the medicine chest without
another word. I went back into Mr. Blake's room, and knocked
at the door of communication. Mr. Bruff opened it, with his
papers in his hand&mdash;immersed in Law, impenetrable to Medicine.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disturb you," I said. "But I am going to
prepare the laudanum for Mr. Blake; and I must request you
to be present and to see what I do."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Bruff, with nine-tenths of his attention riveted
on his papers, and with one-tenth unwillingly accorded to
me. "Anything else?"</p>

<p>"I must trouble you to return here with me, and to see me
administer the dose."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"One thing more. I must put you to the inconvenience of
remaining in Mr. Blake's room to see what happens."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3883]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, very good!" said Mr. Bruff. "My room or Mr. Blake's
room,&mdash;it doesn't matter which; I can go on with my papers
anywhere. Unless you object, Mr. Jennings, to my importing
<i>that</i> amount of common-sense into the proceedings?"</p>

<p>Before I could answer, Mr. Blake addressed himself to the
lawyer, speaking from his bed.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to say that you don't feel any interest
in what you are going to do?" he asked. "Mr. Bruff, you have
no more imagination than a cow!"</p>

<p>"A cow is a very useful animal, Mr. Blake," said the lawyer.
With that reply he followed me out of the room, still keeping
his papers in his hand.</p>

<p>We found Miss Verinder pale and agitated, restlessly pacing
her sitting-room from end to end. At a table in a corner stood
Betteredge, on guard over the medicine chest. Mr. Bruff sat
down on the first chair that he could find, and (emulating the
usefulness of the cow) plunged back again into his papers on
the spot.</p>

<p>Miss Verinder drew me aside, and reverted instantly to her
one all-absorbing interest&mdash;the interest in Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>"How is he now?" she asked. "Is he nervous? is he out of
temper? Do you think it will succeed? Are you sure it will do
no harm?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. Come and see me measure it out."</p>

<p>"One moment. It is past eleven now. How long will it be
before anything happens?"</p>

<p>"It is not easy to say. An hour, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I suppose the room must be dark, as it was last year?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"I shall wait in my bedroom&mdash;just as I did before. I shall
keep the door a little way open. It was a little way open last
year. I will watch the sitting-room door; and the moment it
moves I will blow out my light. It all happened in that way
on my birthday night. And it must all happen again in the
same way, mustn't it?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you can control yourself, Miss Verinder?"</p>

<p>"In <i>his</i> interests I can do anything!" she answered fervently.</p>

<p>One look at her face told me I could trust her. I addressed
myself again to Mr. Bruff.</p>

<p>"I must trouble you to put your papers aside for a moment,"
I said.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3884]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, certainly!" He got up with a start&mdash;as if I had disturbed
him at a particularly interesting place&mdash;and followed me
to the medicine chest. There, deprived of the breathless excitement
incidental to the practice of his profession, he looked at
Betteredge and yawned wearily.</p>

<p>Miss Verinder joined me with a glass jug of cold water
which she had taken from a side table. "Let me pour out the
water," she whispered; "I <i>must</i> have a hand in it!"</p>

<p>I measured out the forty minims from the bottle, and poured
the laudanum into a glass. "Fill it till it is three parts full,"
I said, and handed the glass to Miss Verinder. I then directed
Betteredge to lock up the medicine chest, informing him that I
had done with it now. A look of unutterable relief overspread
the old servant's countenance. He had evidently suspected me
of a medical design on his young lady!</p>

<p>After adding the water as I had directed, Miss Verinder
seized a moment&mdash;while Betteredge was locking the chest and
while Mr. Bruff was looking back at his papers&mdash;and slyly
kissed the rim of the medicine glass. "When you give it to
him," whispered the charming girl, "give it to him on that
side."</p>

<p>I took the piece of crystal which was to represent the Diamond
from my pocket and gave it to her.</p>

<p>"You must have a hand in this too," I said. "You must
put it where you put the Moonstone last year."</p>

<p>She led the way to the Indian cabinet, and put the mock
Diamond into the drawer which the real Diamond had occupied
on the birthday night. Mr. Bruff witnessed this proceeding,
under protest, as he had witnessed everything else. But the
strong dramatic interest which the experiment was now assuming
proved (to my great amusement) to be too much for Betteredge's
capacity of self-restraint. His hand trembled as he held
the candle, and he whispered anxiously, "Are you sure, miss,
it's the right drawer?"</p>

<p>I led the way out again, with the laudanum and water in
my hand. At the door I stood to address a last word to Miss
Verinder.</p>

<p>"Don't be long in putting out the lights," I said.</p>

<p>"I will put them out at once," she answered. "And I will
wait in my bedroom with only one candle alight."</p>

<p>She closed the sitting-room door behind us. Followed by
Bruff and Betteredge, I went back to Mr. Blake's room.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3885]</span></p>

<p>We found him moving restlessly from side to side of the bed,
and wondering irritably whether he was to have the laudanum
that night. In the presence of the two witnesses I gave him
the dose, and shook up his pillows, and told him to lie down
again quietly and wait.</p>

<p>His bed, provided with light chintz curtains, was placed
with the head against the wall of the room, so as to leave a
good open space on either side of it. On one side I drew the
curtains completely, and in the part of the room thus screened
from his view I placed Mr. Bruff and Betteredge to wait for
the result. At the bottom of the bed I half drew the curtains,
and placed my own chair at a little distance, so that I might
let him see me or not see me, just as the circumstances might
direct. Having already been informed that he always slept with
a light in the room, I placed one of the two lighted candles on
a little table at the head of the bed, where the glare of the light
would not strike on his eyes. The other candle I gave to Mr.
Bruff; the light in this instance being subdued by the screen
of the chintz curtains. The window was open at the top so as
to ventilate the room. The rain fell softly; the house was quiet.
It was twenty minutes past eleven by my watch when the preparations
were completed, and I took my place on the chair set
apart at the bottom of the bed.</p>

<p>Mr. Bruff resumed his papers, with every appearance of being
as deeply interested in them as ever. But looking toward him
now, I saw certain signs and tokens which told me that the Law
was beginning to lose its hold on him at last. The suspended
interest of the situation in which we were now placed was slowly
asserting its influence even on <i>his</i> unimaginative mind. As for
Betteredge, consistency of principle and dignity of conduct had
become in his case mere empty words. He forgot that I was
performing a conjuring trick on Mr. Franklin Blake; he forgot
that I had upset the house from top to bottom; he forgot that
I had not read 'Robinson Crusoe' since I was a child. "For the
Lord's sake, sir," he whispered to me, "tell us when it will
begin to work."</p>

<p>"Not before midnight," I whispered back. "Say nothing
and sit still."</p>

<p>Betteredge dropped to the lowest depth of familiarity with
me, without a struggle to save himself. He answered by a
wink!<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3886]</span></p>

<p>Looking next toward Mr. Blake, I found him as restless as
ever in his bed; fretfully wondering why the influence of the
laudanum had not begun to assert itself yet. To tell him in
his present humor that the more he fidgeted and wondered the
longer he would delay the result for which we were now waiting,
would have been simply useless. The wiser course to take
was to dismiss the idea of the opium from his mind by leading
him insensibly to think of something else.</p>

<p>With this view I encouraged him to talk to me, contriving so
to direct the conversation, on my side, as to lead him back again
to the subject which had engaged us earlier in the evening,&mdash;the
subject of the Diamond. I took care to revert to those portions
of the story of the Moonstone which related to the transport
of it from London to Yorkshire; to the risk which Mr.
Blake had run in removing it from the bank at Frizinghall; and
to the expected appearance of the Indians at the house on the
evening of the birthday. And I purposely assumed, in referring
to these events, to have misunderstood much of what Mr. Blake
himself had told me a few hours since. In this way I set him
talking on the subject with which it was now vitally important
to fill his mind&mdash;without allowing him to suspect that I was
making him talk for a purpose. Little by little he became so
interested in putting me right that he forgot to fidget in the
bed. His mind was far away from the question of the opium at
the all-important time when his eyes first told me that the
opium was beginning to lay its hold upon his brain.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch. It wanted five minutes to twelve
when the premonitory symptoms of the working of the laudanum
first showed themselves to me.</p>

<p>At this time no unpracticed eye would have detected any
change in him. But as the minutes of the new morning wore
away, the swiftly subtle progress of the influence began to show
itself more plainly. The sublime intoxication of opium gleamed
in his eyes; the dew of a steady perspiration began to glisten on
his face. In five minutes more the talk which he still kept up
with me failed in coherence. He held steadily to the subject of
the Diamond; but he ceased to complete his sentences. A little
later the sentences dropped to single words. Then there was an
interval of silence. Then he sat up in bed. Then, still busy
with the subject of the Diamond, he began to talk again&mdash;not
to me but to himself. That change told me the first stage in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3887]</span>
the experiment was reached.  The stimulant influence of the
opium had got him.</p>

<p>The time now was twenty-three minutes past twelve. The
next half-hour, at most, would decide the question of whether he
would or would not get up from his bed and leave the room.</p>

<p>In the breathless interest of watching him&mdash;in the unutterable
triumph of seeing the first result of the experiment declare
itself in the manner, and nearly at the time, which I had anticipated&mdash;I
had utterly forgotten the two companions of my night
vigil. Looking toward them now, I saw the Law (as represented
by Mr. Bruff's papers) lying unheeded on the floor. Mr. Bruff
himself was looking eagerly through a crevice left in the imperfectly
drawn curtains of the bed. And Betteredge, oblivious of
all respect for social distinctions, was peeping over Mr. Bruff's
shoulder.</p>

<p>They both started back on finding that I was looking at
them, like two boys caught out by their schoolmaster in a fault.
I signed to them to take off their boots quietly, as I was taking
off mine. If Mr. Blake gave us the chance of following him, it
was vitally necessary to follow him without noise.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed&mdash;and nothing happened.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly threw the bedclothes off him. He put
one leg out of bed. He waited.</p>

<p>"I wish I had never taken it out of the bank," he said to
himself. "It was safe in the bank."</p>

<p>My heart throbbed fast; the pulses at my temples beat furiously.
The doubt about the safety of the Diamond was once
more the dominant impression in his brain! On that one pivot
the whole success of the experiment turned. The prospect thus
suddenly opened before me was too much for my shattered
nerves. I was obliged to look away from him, or I should have
lost my self-control.</p>

<p>There was another interval of silence.</p>

<p>When I could trust myself to look back at him he was out
of his bed, standing erect at the side of it. The pupils of his
eyes were now contracted; his eyeballs gleamed in the light of
the candle as he moved his head slowly to and fro. He was
thinking; he was doubting; he spoke again.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" he said. "The Indians may be hidden
in the house."</p>

<p>He stopped, and walked slowly to the other end of the room.
He turned,&mdash;waited,&mdash;came back to the bed.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3888]</span></p>

<p>"It's not even locked up," he went on. "It's in the drawer
of her cabinet. And the drawer doesn't lock."</p>

<p>He sat down on the side of the bed. "Anybody might take
it," he said.</p>

<p>He rose again restlessly, and reiterated his first words. "How
do I know? The Indians may be hidden in the house."</p>

<p>He waited again. I drew back behind the half-curtain of the
bed. He looked about the room, with the vacant glitter in his
eyes. It was a breathless moment. There was a pause of some
sort. A pause in the action of the opium? a pause in the action
of the brain? Who could tell? Everything depended now on
what he did next.</p>

<p>He laid himself down again on the bed!</p>

<p>A horrible doubt crossed my mind. Was it possible that the
sedative action of the opium was making itself felt already? It
was not in my experience that it should do this. But what is
experience where opium is concerned? There are probably no
two men in existence on whom the drug acts in exactly the
same manner. Was some constitutional peculiarity in him feeling
the influence in some new way? Were we to fail, on the
very brink of success?</p>

<p>No! He got up again very abruptly. "How the devil am I
to sleep," he said, "with <i>this</i> on my mind?"</p>

<p>He looked at the light burning on the table at the head of
his bed. After a moment he took the candle in his hand.</p>

<p>I blew out the second candle burning behind the closed curtains.
I drew back, with Mr. Bruff and Betteredge, into the
farthest corner by the bed. I signed to them to be silent, as if
their lives depended on it.</p>

<p>We waited&mdash;seeing and hearing nothing. We waited, hidden
from him by the curtains.</p>

<p>The light which he was holding on the other side of us moved
suddenly. The next moment he passed us, swift and noiseless,
with the candle in his hand.</p>

<p>He opened the bedroom door and went out.</p>

<p>We followed him along the corridor. We followed him down
the stairs. We followed him along the second corridor. He
never looked back; he never hesitated.</p>

<p>He opened the sitting-room door and went in, leaving it
open behind him.</p>

<p>The door was hung (like all the other doors in the house) on
large old-fashioned hinges. When it was opened, a crevice was<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3889]</span>
opened between the door and the post. I signed to my two
companions to look through this, so as to keep them from showing
themselves. I placed myself&mdash;outside the door also&mdash;on the
opposite side. A recess in the wall was at my left hand, in
which I could instantly hide myself if he showed any signs of
looking back into the corridor.</p>

<p>He advanced to the middle of the room, with the candle still
in his hand; he looked about him,&mdash;but he never looked back.</p>

<p>I saw the door of Miss Verinder's bedroom standing ajar.
She had put out her light. She controlled herself nobly. The
dim white outline of her summer dress was all that I could see.
Nobody who had not known it beforehand would have suspected
that there was a living creature in the room. She kept back in
the dark; not a word, not a movement escaped her.</p>

<p>It was now ten minutes past one. I heard through the
silence the soft drip of the rain, and the tremulous passage of
the night air through the trees.</p>

<p>After waiting irresolute for a minute or more in the middle
of the room, he moved to the corner near the window where the
Indian cabinet stood.</p>

<p>He put his candle on the top of the cabinet. He opened and
shut one drawer after another, until he came to the drawer in
which the mock Diamond was put. He looked into the drawer
for a moment. Then he took the mock Diamond out with his
right hand. With the other hand he took the candle from the
top of the cabinet.</p>

<p>He walked back a few steps toward the middle of the room
and stood still again.</p>

<p>Thus far he had exactly repeated what he had done on the
birthday night. Would his next proceeding be the same as the
proceeding of last year? Would he leave the room? Would he
go back now, as I believed he had gone back then, to his bed-chamber?
Would he show us what he had done with the Diamond
when he had returned to his own room?</p>

<p>His first action, when he moved once more, proved to be an
action which he had <i>not</i> performed when he was under the influence
of the opium for the first time. He put the candle
down on a table and wandered on a little toward the farther
end of the room. There was a sofa here. He leaned heavily
on the back of it with his left hand&mdash;then roused himself and
returned to the middle of the room. I could now see his eyes.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3890]</span>
They were getting dull and heavy; the glitter in them was fast
dying out.</p>

<p>The suspense of the moment proved too much for Miss Verinder's
self-control. She advanced a few steps,&mdash;then stopped
again. Mr. Bruff and Betteredge looked across the open doorway
at me for the first time. The prevision of a coming disappointment
was impressing itself on their minds as well as on
mine. Still, so long as he stood where he was, there was hope.
We waited in unutterable expectation to see what would happen
next.</p>

<p>The next event was decisive. He let the mock Diamond
drop out of his hand.</p>

<p>It fell on the floor, before the doorway&mdash;plainly visible to
him and to every one. He made no effort to pick it up; he
looked down at it vacantly, and as he looked, his head sank on
his breast. He staggered&mdash;roused himself for an instant&mdash;walked
back unsteadily to the sofa&mdash;and sat down on it. He
made a last effort; he tried to rise, and sank back. His head
fell on the sofa cushions. It was then twenty-five minutes past
one o'clock. Before I had put my watch back in my pocket he
was asleep.</p>

<p>It was over now. The sedative influence had got him; the
experiment was at an end.</p>

<p>I entered the room, telling Mr. Bruff and Betteredge that
they might follow me. There was no fear of disturbing him.
We were free to move and speak.</p>

<p>"The first thing to settle," I said, "is the question of what
we are to do with him. He will probably sleep for the next six
or seven hours at least. It is some distance to carry him back
to his own room. When I was younger I could have done it
alone. But my health and strength are not what they were&mdash;I
am afraid I will have to ask you to help me."</p>

<p>Before they could answer, Miss Verinder called to me softly.
She met me at the door of her room with a light shawl and
with the counterpane from her own bed.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to watch him while he sleeps?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am not sure enough of the action of the opium in
this case, to be willing to leave him alone."</p>

<p>She handed me the shawl and the counterpane.</p>

<p>"Why should you disturb him?" she whispered. "Make his
bed on the sofa. I can shut my door and keep in my room."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3891]</span></p>

<p>It was infinitely the simplest and the safest way of disposing
of him for the night. I mentioned the suggestion to Mr. Bruff
and Betteredge, who both approved of my adopting it. In five
minutes I had laid him comfortably on the sofa, and had
covered him lightly with the counterpane and the shawl. Miss
Verinder wished us good-night and closed the door. At my
request we three then drew round the table in the middle of
the room, on which the candle was still burning, and on which
writing materials were placed.</p>

<p>"Before we separate," I began, "I have a word to say about
the experiment which has been tried to-night. Two distinct
objects were to be gained by it. The first of these objects was
to prove that Mr. Blake entered this room and took the Diamond
last year, acting unconsciously and irresponsibly, under the
influence of opium. After what you have both seen, are you
both satisfied so far?"</p>

<p>They answered me in the affirmative, without a moment's
hesitation.</p>

<p>"The second object," I went on, "was to discover what he
did with the Diamond after he was seen by Miss Verinder to
leave her sitting-room with the jewel in his hand on the birthday
night. The gaining of this object depended, of course, on his
still continuing exactly to repeat his proceedings of last year.
He has failed to do that; and the purpose of the experiment is
defeated accordingly. I can't assert that I am not disappointed
at the result&mdash;but I can honestly say that I am not surprised
by it. I told Mr. Blake from the first that our complete success
in this matter depended on our completely reproducing in him
the physical and moral conditions of last year; and I warned
him that this was the next thing to a downright impossibility.
We have only partially reproduced the conditions, and the experiment
has been only partially successful in consequence. It is
also possible that I may have administered too large a dose of
laudanum. But I myself look upon the first reason that I have
given as the true reason why we have to lament a failure, as
well as to rejoice over a success."</p>

<p>After saying those words I put the writing materials before
Mr. Bruff, and asked him if he had any objection, before we
separated for the night, to draw out and sign a plain statement
of what he had seen. He at once took the pen, and produced
the statement with the fluent readiness of a practiced hand.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3892]</span></p>

<p>"I owe you this," he said, signing the paper, "as some
atonement for what passed between us earlier in the evening. I
beg your pardon, Mr. Jennings, for having doubted you. You
have done Franklin Blake an inestimable service. In our legal
phrase, you have proved your case."</p>

<p>Betteredge's apology was characteristic of the man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jennings," he said, "when you read 'Robinson Crusoe'
again (which I strongly recommend you to do), you will find
that he never scruples to acknowledge it when he turns out to
have been in the wrong. Please to consider me, sir, as doing
what Robinson Crusoe did on the present occasion." With those
words he signed the paper in his turn.</p>

<p>Mr. Bruff took me aside as we rose from the table.</p>

<p>"One word about the Diamond," he said. "Your theory is
that Franklin Blake hid the Moonstone in his room. My theory
is that the Moonstone is in the possession of Mr. Luker's
bankers in London. We won't dispute which of us is right.
We will only ask, which of us is in a position to put his theory
to the test first?"</p>

<p>"The test in my case," I answered, "has been tried to-night,
and has failed."</p>

<p>"The test in my case," rejoined Mr. Bruff, "is still in process
of trial. For the last two days I have had a watch set for
Mr. Luker at the bank; and I shall cause that watch to be continued
until the last day of the month. I know that he must
take the Diamond himself out of his bankers' hands, and I am
acting on the chance that the person who has pledged the Diamond
may force him to do this by redeeming the pledge. In
that case I may be able to lay my hand on the person. And
there is a prospect of our clearing up the mystery exactly at
the point where the mystery baffles us now! Do you admit that,
so far?"</p>

<p>I admitted it readily.</p>

<p>"I am going back to town by the ten o'clock train," pursued
the lawyer. "I may hear, when I get back, that a discovery has
been made&mdash;and it may be of the greatest importance that I
should have Franklin Blake at hand to appeal to if necessary.
I intend to tell him, as soon as he wakes, that he must return
with me to London. After all that has happened, may I trust
to your influence to back me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" I said.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3893]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bruff shook hands with me and left the room. Betteredge
followed him out.</p>

<p>I went to the sofa to look at Mr. Blake. He had not moved
since I had laid him down and made his bed,&mdash;he lay locked in
a deep and quiet sleep.</p>

<p>While I was still looking at him I heard the bedroom door
softly opened. Once more Miss Verinder appeared on the threshold
in her pretty summer dress.</p>

<p>"Do me a last favor," she whispered. "Let me watch him
with you."</p>

<p>I hesitated&mdash;not in the interest of propriety; only in the
interest of her night's rest. She came close to me and took my
hand.</p>

<p>"I can't sleep; I can't even sit still in my own room," she
said. "Oh, Mr. Jennings, if you were me, only think how you
would long to sit and look at him! Say yes! Do!"</p>

<p>Is it necessary to mention that I gave way? Surely not!</p>

<p>She drew a chair to the foot of the sofa. She looked at him
in a silent ecstasy of happiness till the tears rose in her eyes.
She dried her eyes and said she would fetch her work. She
fetched her work, and never did a single stitch of it. It lay in
her lap&mdash;she was not even able to look away from him long
enough to thread her needle. I thought of my own youth; I
thought of the gentle eyes which had once looked love at <i>me</i>.
In the heaviness of my heart I turned to my Journal for relief,
and wrote in it what is written here.</p>

<p>So we kept our watch together in silence,&mdash;one of us absorbed
in his writing; the other absorbed in her love.</p>

<p>Hour after hour he lay in deep sleep. The light of the new
day grew and grew in the room, and still he never moved.</p>

<p>Toward six o'clock I felt the warning which told me that my
pains were coming back. I was obliged to leave her alone with
him for a little while. I said I would go up-stairs and fetch
another pillow for him out of his room. It was not a long attack
this time. In a little while I was able to venture back and let
her see me again.</p>

<p>I found her at the head of the sofa when I returned. She
was just touching his forehead with her lips. I shook my head
as soberly as I could, and pointed to her chair. She looked back
at me with a bright smile and a charming color in her face.
"You would have done it," she whispered, "in my place!"...<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3894]</span></p>

<p>It is just eight o'clock. He is beginning to move for the first
time.</p>

<p>Miss Verinder is kneeling by the side of the sofa. She has
so placed herself that when his eyes first open they must open
upon her face.</p>

<p>Shall I leave them together?</p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<h3><a name="COUNT_FOSCO" id="COUNT_FOSCO"></a>COUNT FOSCO</h3>

<h4>From 'The Woman in White'</h4>


<p>He looks like a man who could tame anything. If he married
a tigress instead of a woman, he would have tamed
the tigress. If he had married <i>me</i>, I should have made
his cigarettes as his wife does; I should have held my tongue
when he looked at me as she holds hers.</p>

<p>I am almost afraid to confess it even to these secret pages.
The man has interested me, has attracted me, has forced me
to like him. In two short days he has made his way straight
into my favorable estimation; and how he has worked the
miracle is more than I can tell.</p>

<p>It absolutely startles me, now he is in my mind, to find
how plainly I see him! how much more plainly than I see Sir
Percival, or Mr. Fairlie, or Walter Hartright, or any other
absent person of whom I think, with the one exception of
Laura herself. I can hear his voice as if he was speaking at
this moment. I know what his conversation was yesterday,
as well as if I was hearing it now. How am I to describe
him? There are peculiarities in his personal appearance, his
habits, and his amusements, which I should blame in the boldest
terms or ridicule in the most merciless manner, if I had seen
them in another man. What is it that makes me unable to
blame them or to ridicule them in <i>him</i>?</p>

<p>For example, he is immensely fat. Before this time, I have
always especially disliked corpulent humanity. I have always
maintained that the popular notion of connecting excessive grossness
of size and excessive good-humor as inseparable allies was
equivalent to declaring either that no people but amiable people
ever get fat, or that the accidental addition of so many
pounds of flesh has a directly favorable influence over the dis<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3895]</span>position
of the person on whose body they accumulate. I have
invariably combated both these absurd assertions by quoting
examples of fat people who were as mean, vicious, and cruel
as the leanest and worst of their neighbors. I have asked
whether Henry the Eighth was an amiable character? whether
Pope Alexander the Sixth was a good man? whether Mr.
Murderer and Mrs. Murderess Manning were not both unusually
stout people? whether hired nurses, proverbially as cruel a set
of women as are to be found in all England, were not, for
the most part, also as fat a set of women as are to be found
in all England?&mdash;and so on through dozens of other examples,
modern and ancient, native and foreign, high and low. Holding
these strong opinions on the subject with might and main,
as I do at this moment, here nevertheless is Count Fosco, as
fat as Henry the Eighth himself, established in my favor at
one day's notice, without let or hindrance from his own odious
corpulence. Marvelous indeed!</p>

<p>Is it his face that has recommended him?</p>

<p>It may be his face. He is a most remarkable likeness, on a
large scale, of the great Napoleon. His features have Napoleon's
magnificent regularity; his expression recalls the grandly
calm immovable power of the Great Soldier's face. This striking
resemblance certainly impressed me, to begin with; but
there is something in him besides the resemblance, which has
impressed me more. I think the influence I am now trying to
find is in his eyes. They are the most unfathomable gray eyes
I ever saw; and they have at times a cold, clear, beautiful, irresistible
glitter in them, which forces me to look at him, and yet
causes me sensations, when I do look, which I would rather not
feel. Other parts of his face and head have their strange peculiarities.
His complexion, for instance, has a singular sallow-fairness,
so much at variance with the dark-brown color of his
hair that I suspect the hair of being a wig; and his face, closely
shaven all over, is smoother and freer from all marks and
wrinkles than mine, though (according to Sir Percival's account
of him) he is close on sixty years of age. But these are not the
prominent personal characteristics which distinguish him, to my
mind, from all the other men I have ever seen. The marked
peculiarity which singles him out from the rank and file of
humanity lies entirely, so far as I can tell at present, in the
extraordinary expression and extraordinary power of his eyes.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3896]</span></p>

<p>His manner, and his command of our language, may also
have assisted him in some degree to establish himself in my
good opinion. He has that quiet deference, that look of pleased
attentive interest, in listening to a woman, and that secret gentleness
in his voice in speaking to a woman, which say what
we may, we can none of us resist. Here too his unusual command
of the English language necessarily helps him. I had
often heard of the extraordinary aptitude which many Italians
show in mastering our strong hard Northern speech, but until I
saw Count Fosco I had never supposed it possible that any
foreigner could have spoken English as he speaks it. There are
times when it is almost impossible to detect by his accent that
he is not a countryman of our own; and as for fluency, there
are very few born Englishmen who can talk with as few stoppages
and repetitions as the Count. He may construct his sentences
more or less in the foreign way; but I have never yet
heard him use a wrong expression, or hesitate for a moment in
his choice of words.</p>

<p>All the smallest characteristics of this strange man have
something strikingly original and perplexingly contradictory in
them. Fat as he is, and old as he is, his movements are astonishingly
light and easy. He is as noiseless in a room as any of
us women; and more than that, with all his look of unmistakable
mental firmness and power, he is as nervously sensitive as
the weakest of us. He starts at chance noises as inveterately
as Laura herself. He winced and shuddered yesterday when Sir
Percival beat one of the spaniels, so that I felt ashamed of my
own want of tenderness and sensibility by comparison with
the Count.</p>

<p>The relation of this last incident reminds me of one of his
most curious peculiarities, which I have not yet mentioned&mdash;his
extraordinary fondness for pet animals.</p>

<p>Some of these he has left on the Continent; but he has
brought with him to this house a cockatoo, two canary-birds,
and a whole family of white mice. He attends to all the necessities
of these strange favorites himself, and he has taught the
creatures to be surprisingly fond of him and familiar with him.
The cockatoo, a most vicious and treacherous bird toward every
one else, absolutely seems to love him. When he lets it out of
its cage it hops on to his knee, and claws its way up his great
big body, and rubs its topknot against his sallow double chin in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3897]</span>
the most caressing manner imaginable. He has only to set the
doors of the canaries' cage open, and to call them; and the
pretty little cleverly trained creatures perch fearlessly on his
hand, mount his fat outstretched fingers one by one when he
tells them to "go up-stairs," and sing together as if they would
burst their throats with delight when they get to the top finger.
His white mice live in a little pagoda of gayly painted wire-work,
designed and made by himself. They are almost as tame
as the canaries, and they are perpetually let out, like the canaries.
They crawl all over him, popping in and out of his waistcoat,
and sitting in couples, white as snow, on his capacious
shoulders. He seems to be even fonder of his mice than of his
other pets; smiles at them, and kisses them, and calls them all
sorts of endearing names. If it be possible to suppose an
Englishman with any taste for such childish interests and amusements
as these, that Englishman would certainly feel rather
ashamed of them, and would be anxious to apologize for them
in the company of grown-up people. But the Count apparently
sees nothing ridiculous in the amazing contrast between his
colossal self and his frail little pets. He would blandly kiss his
white mice and twitter to his canary-birds amidst an assembly
of English fox-hunters, and would only pity them as barbarians
when they were all laughing their loudest at him.</p>

<p>It seems hardly credible while I am writing it down, but it
is certainly true that this same man, who has all the fondness
of an old maid for his cockatoo, and all the small dexterities
of an organ-boy in managing his white mice, can talk, when
anything happens to rouse him, with a daring independence of
thought, a knowledge of books in every language, and an
experience of society in half the capitals of Europe, which
would make him the prominent personage of any assembly
in the civilized world. This trainer of canary-birds, this architect
of a pagoda for white mice, is (as Sir Percival himself has
told me) one of the first experimental chemists living, and has
discovered among other wonderful inventions a means of petrifying
the body after death, so as to preserve it, as hard as
marble, to the end of time. This fat, indolent, elderly man,
whose nerves are so finely strung that he starts at chance
noises, and winces when he sees a house spaniel get a whipping,
went into the stable-yard the morning after his arrival, and put
his hand on the head of a chained bloodhound&mdash;a beast so<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3898]</span>
savage that the very groom who feeds him keeps out of his
reach. His wife and I were present, and I shall not forget the
scene that followed, short as it was.</p>

<p>"Mind that dog, sir," said the groom; "he flies at everybody!"
"He does that, my friend," replied the Count quietly,
"because everybody is afraid of him. Let us see if he flies at
<i>me</i>." And he laid his plump yellow-white fingers, on which the
canary-birds had been perching ten minutes before, upon the
formidable brute's head, and looked him straight in the eyes.
"You big dogs are all cowards," he said, addressing the animal
contemptuously, with his face and the dog's within an inch of
each other. "You would kill a poor cat, you infernal coward.
You would fly at a starving beggar, you infernal coward. Anything
that you can surprise unawares&mdash;anything that is afraid
of your big body, and your wicked white teeth, and your slobbering,
bloodthirsty mouth, is the thing you like to fly at. You
could throttle me at this moment, you mean miserable bully;
and you daren't so much as look me in the face, because I'm
not afraid of you. Will you think better of it, and try your
teeth in my fat neck? Bah! not you!" He turned away, laughing
at the astonishment of the men in the yard; and the dog
crept back meekly to his kennel. "Ah! my nice waistcoat!" he
said pathetically. "I am sorry I came here. Some of that
brute's slobber has got on my pretty clean waistcoat." Those
words express another of his incomprehensible oddities. He is
as fond of fine clothes as the veriest fool in existence, and has
appeared in four magnificent waistcoats already&mdash;all of light
garish colors and all immensely large, even for him&mdash;in the
two days of his residence at Blackwater Park.</p>

<p>His tact and cleverness in small things are quite as noticeable
as the singular inconsistencies in his character, and the childish
triviality of his ordinary tastes and pursuits.</p>

<p>I can see already that he means to live on excellent terms
with all of us during the period of his sojourn in this place.
He has evidently discovered that Laura secretly dislikes him (she
confessed as much to me when I pressed her on the subject),
but he has also found out that she is extravagantly fond of
flowers. Whenever she wants a nosegay he has got one to give
her, gathered and arranged by himself; and greatly to my amusement,
he is always cunningly provided with a duplicate, composed
of exactly the same flowers, grouped in exactly the same<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3899]</span>
way, to appease his icily jealous wife, before she can so much as
think herself aggrieved. His management of the Countess (in
public) is a sight to see. He bows to her; he habitually addresses
her as "my angel"; he carries his canaries to pay her
little visits on his fingers, and to sing to her; he kisses her
hand when she gives him his cigarettes; he presents her with
sugar-plums in return, which he puts into her mouth playfully,
from a box in his pocket. The rod of iron with which he rules
her never appears in company&mdash;it is a private rod and is always
kept up-stairs.</p>

<p>His method of recommending himself to <i>me</i> is entirely different.
He flatters my vanity by talking to me as seriously and
sensibly as if I was a man. Yes! I can find him out when I
am away from him; I know he flatters my vanity, when I think
of him up here in my own room&mdash;and yet when I go down-stairs
and get into his company again he will blind me again,
and I shall be flattered again, just as if I had never found him
out at all! He can manage me as he manages his wife and
Laura, as he manages the bloodhound in the stable yard, as he
manages Sir Percival himself every hour in the day. "My good
Percival! how I like your rough English humor!"&mdash;"My good
Percival! how I enjoy your solid English sense!" He puts the
rudest remarks Sir Percival can make on his effeminate tastes
and amusements quietly away from him in that manner&mdash;always
calling the baronet by his Christian name; smiling at him with
the calmest superiority; patting him on the shoulder; and bearing
with him benignantly, as a good-humored father bears with
a wayward son.</p>

<p>The interest which I really cannot help feeling in this
strangely original man has led me to question Sir Percival about
his past life.</p>

<p>Sir Percival either knows little, or will tell me little about it.
He and the Count first met many years ago, at Rome, under
the dangerous circumstances to which I have alluded elsewhere.
Since that time they have been perpetually together, in London,
in Paris, and in Vienna&mdash;but never in Italy again; the Count
having, oddly enough, not crossed the frontiers of his native
country for years past. Perhaps he has been made the victim
of some political persecution? At all events, he seems to be
patriotically anxious not to lose sight of any of his own countrymen
who may happen to be in England. On the evening of<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3900]</span>
his arrival, he asked how far we were from the nearest town,
and whether we knew of any Italian gentlemen who might happen
to be settled there. He is certainly in correspondence with
people on the Continent, for his letters have all sorts of odd
stamps on them; and I saw one for him this morning, waiting
in his place at the breakfast-table, with a huge official-looking
seal on it. Perhaps he is in correspondence with his government?
And yet that is hardly to be reconciled, either, with my
other idea that he may be a political exile.</p>

<p>How much I seem to have written about Count Fosco! And
what does it all amount to?&mdash;as poor dear Mr. Gilmore would
ask in his impenetrable business-like way. I can only repeat
that I do assuredly feel, even on this short acquaintance, a
strange, half-willing, half-unwilling liking for the Count. He
seems to have established over me the same sort of ascendency
which he has evidently gained over Sir Percival. Free and even
rude as he may occasionally be in his manner toward his fat
friend, Sir Percival is nevertheless afraid, as I can plainly see,
of giving any serious offense to the Count. I wonder whether
I am afraid too? I certainly never saw a man, in all my experience,
whom I should be so sorry to have for an enemy. Is
this because I like him, or because I am afraid of him? <i>Chi
sa?</i>&mdash;as Count Fosco might say in his own language. Who
knows?</p>
